1.We are given with semi-structured data (structured data with missing fileds) of wine reviews by various people.
2.The data comprises of serial number,country,description,designation,points,price,province,region_1,region_2,variety,winery out of which
  we need only country to which the wine belongs to,it's description/review price and the point given to the wine.
3. Data is too big and comprises of more than 150000 data but since some lines lacks some data so we have to skip those.
4. The task is to present wine data in decreasing order of quality.This is calculated on the basis of points it receives and the price of the wine.
5. Wine Review jar simply extracts of useful data but data extracted contains many redundant (duplicate) enteries which is taken care in stage1.
