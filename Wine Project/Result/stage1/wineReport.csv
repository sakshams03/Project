France, , A big, powerful wine that sums up the richness of the vintage. It is densely fruity, spicy with an enormous black plum and berry fruit character to go with the acidity. It's concentrated while still showing such wonderfully pure fruit. The aging potential is immense., 99.0, 2300.0
US, Roger Rose Vineyard, The nose on this single-vineyard wine from a strong, often overlooked appellation is tight and minerally before showing a slightly tropical kiwi element. Brightly acidic on the lively palate, flavors range from Key lime and Meyer lemon to pear skins and apple flesh., 91.0, 2013.0
France, , A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit. It has more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual, giving intense black currant flavors with enticing acidity balanced by the sweetness of the fruit. Ripe swathes of this opulent fruit are also elegant and structured., 98.0, 1900.0
France, Clos du Mesnil, A wine that has created its own universe. It has a unique, special softness that allies with the total purity that comes from a small, enclosed single vineyard. The fruit is almost irrelevant here, because it comes as part of a much deeper complexity. This is a great wine, at the summit of Champagne, a sublime, unforgettable experience., 100.0, 1400.0

France, , The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging. At this stage, wood shows through the fruit, but the texture is so rich and opulent that it should easily become integrated., 96.0, 1300.0
France, , Solid, very structured, packed with dense and dry tannins. There is a core of acidity and darkness that gives the wine a brooding, powerful character. At this stage, it seems austere although it does have the weight of fruit typical of the year., 96.0, 1200.0
Austria, Ried Loibenberg Smaragd, Wet earth, rain-wet stones, damp moss, wild sage and very ripe pear make for a complex opening. Further sniffs reveal more citrus: both juice and zest of lemon. The palate still holds a lot of leesy yeast flavors but its phenolic richness is tempered by total citrus freshness. This is still tightly wound; leave it so it can come into its own. The warming resonance on the palate suggests it has a long future. Drink from 2019., 94.0, 1100.0
France, , Such a generous and ripe wine, with a dark core of tannins surrounded by opulent fruit. Black fruits, coffee, very concentrated flavors, a powerhouse of structure and richness. The warmth of the wine is palpable, as is the aging potential., 97.0, 1100.0
France, , This is the first vintage of a wine that used to be called Laville Haut-Brion. It is ripe and opulent with exotic fruits and generosity, very open, very rich. Pineapple, yellow fruits and toast are all present., 94.0, 1000.0
Portugal, Colheita White, This was a great vintage Port year, and this white Port, which was bottled in 2015, has hints of the firm tannins and structure that marked out the year. It also has preserved an amazing amount of freshness still suggesting orange marmalade flavors. These are backed up by the fine, concentrated old wood tastes. The wine is, of course, ready to drink., 94.0, 980.0
Italy, Riserva, Biondi-Santi performs exceptionally well in elegant vintages like 2006. This wine is balanced and fresh, with lingering notes of wild berry, white cherry, cola, spice and dark chocolate. Age this wine 10 years or more., 94.0, 900.0
France, , While there is certainly plenty of wood here, the wine has weight and impressive concentration for the year. The tannins are still brooding away, giving a dark firm character to the wine. Blackberry fruits and acidity are there, but still well buried in the tannins., 95.0, 850.0
Australia, Grange, This has all the size and weight you've come to expect from Australia's most famous wine. Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest. That said, the texture isn't quite as tight or as fine as some other vintages—expect this to be early maturing by Grange standards, and best from 2020–2040., 98.0, 850.0

Italy, Riserva, Thanks to having some of the highest vineyards in Montalcino, Biondi Santi was able to make a stunning Riserva in the hot and forward 2007 vintage. It opens with aromas of forest floor and dried rose petals. The palate showcases concentrated wild cherry and cinnamon-spice flavors alongside bracing tannins. The wine already boasts impressive depth and structure as well as remarkable freshness for the vintage, but give it time to fully develop. Drink 2017–2037., 94.0, 800.0
France, , Full of ripe fruit, opulent and concentrated, this is a fabulous and impressive wine. It has a beautiful line of acidity balanced with ripe fruits. The wood aging is subtle, just a hint of smokiness and toast. This is one of those wines, from a great white wine vintage, that will age many years. Drink from 2024., 100.0, 848.0
Portugal, Colheita Tawny, While this wine from a year that was not declared as a vintage, it has sweetness and ripe caramel and toffee character and it does, inevitably, show some age. So the acidity and intense wood flavors are dominant, giving a wine that is dry while still very drinkable. It is a Port that is so concentrated and dense—the distillation of a tawny. Drink this impressive wine now., 93.0, 770.0
France, , The palate opens slowly, offering an initial citrus character, followed by wood and then, finally, wonderfully rich, but taut fruit. There is still a toast character here, with apricots and pear on top of the citrus, but it is still only just developing. In 10–15 years, it will be a magnificent wine., 98.0, 800.0

Germany, Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese, Dusty earth and mineral tones lend contrast to sweet, sunny tangerine and caramel in this feather-light TBA. The palate is persistent and pristine, awash in stone fruit flavors that pierce with laser-like brilliance. Delectable now for it's youth and fruitiness, but likely to develop mineral complexities for decades to come., 95.0, 775.0
Germany, Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese, Perfumed florals mingle curiously with deep, dusty mineral notes on this bracing TBA. Sunny nectarine and tangerine flavors are mouthwatering and juicy, struck with acidity, then plunged into pools of sweet honey and nectar. It's a delightful sensory roller coaster that feels endless on the finish., 95.0, 775.0
Hungary, Essencia, Surprisingly subtle, yet maddeningly complex, this is a rare treat to unravel slowly, sip by sip. Sweet and honeyed on the nose with scents of freesia, orange peel and stone fruit, but accented with just a hint of sun-dried hay. The palate is deeply concentrated with undulating waves of honey, beeswax and fruit, but balanced with striking tangerine acidity. Remarkably long on the finish., 94.0, 764.0
Spain, El Perer, This single-vineyard Carignan is living proof of how impressive the variety can be, especially when hailing from a top year like 2012. Schisty aromas of blackberry, chocolate and mocha are smooth and alluring. This feels focused, pure and juicy, while dense blackberry, mocha and baking spice flavors tail off with exotic notes of Malabar pepper, toast and the finest black coffee. Drink through 2023., 96.0, 770.0
France, Les Quatre Journaux, Solid and tannic, it perhaps lacks huge weight but shows elegant structure and rounded tannins. The wine is already deliciously fruity, and will charm as it ages. Black fruits are right up front, the tannins a fine supporting act. Drink from 2017., 93.0, 740.0
France, , From arguably the finest white wine vineyard in Burgundy, this is a powerful wine that shows great weight, but balances that with intense, elegant structure, style and freshness. The flavors are endless and complex, richness combining with the lively character of the vintage. Age for many years., 98.0, 757.0

Germany, Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese, Sweet and savory interplay through this exotic TBA, balancing waves of candied orange rind and caramelized sugar with umami-rich notes of sea breeze and dried herb. It's delicate on the palate, but lingers long with bright tangerine acidity. Delicious now, but would be fascinating to try in 10 years., 92.0, 670.0

France, , With 83% Sémillon in the blend, this wine has weight as well as richness. At the same time, it has a crisp edge, a smoky character from wood aging and the fine balance between citrus and more exotic fruits. It is a wine to age for many years. Drink from 2022., 97.0, 698.0
France, , The wine shows the power typical of a Lafite but within the context of the fruity 2011 vintage. The immensely dense tannic structure gives the wine a solid feel that is lifted by so much ripe black currant and berry fruits. At the back, the wine has a more brooding, dark character that suggests great aging potential. Drink this wine from 2019., 96.0, 685.0
France, La Cabotte, From a parcel within the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, this is beautifully balanced, but a wine with considerable potential. It is rich, but thrust through with a sword of steel, giving acidity that offers a succulent counterpoint to the yellow fruits. The wood is becoming well integrated, offering further richness. For long-term aging., 96.0, 660.0

For long-term aging., 96.0, 660.0
France, , Big tannins and impressive fruits are the hallmarks of this impressive wine. It is also subtle, not showing all its flavors at once, hiding beneath tannins and structure. For this fruity vintage, it shows a strong sense of direct, solid structure, only allowing the strong black plum and berry flavors to come through slowly. It is for the long haul, so don't drink before 2022, even better later., 97.0, 660.0
Italy, , A rich, ripe expression of one of Italy's iconic wines, this displays the heat of the 2011 vintage. It opens with aromas of red currants, tobacco, oak and exotic spice while the full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherries, blueberry extract, licorice and black pepper. Densely concentrated and tightly packed with assertive but fine-grained tannins, you'll need to give this time to unwind. Drink 2017–2026., 94.0, 625.0
France, , A firm and tannic wine, this has dry spices, dark fruits and concentration. Great depth of flavor gives a serious wine that also has a fruit-driven profile. Concentrated dark tannins push this wine to a great height and impressive length. Drink from 2020., 97.0, 639.0

Australia, Hill of Grace, This stellar wine takes a little time in the glass to show its true class, but once it's properly aerated, the aromas go from rather vague and lifted to plummy and spice laden. In the mouth, it's rich, creamy-textured and lush, offering the flavors of plum pudding without the excessive weight that the words suggest, plus hints of grilled meat. Again, with airing, it gets even better, piling on more red fruit notes and turning more elegant. A great example of Shiraz, but how many people will be able to justify the $25/ounce expenditure?, 95.0, 625.0
France, , This is a powerful wine, driven by fruit and dark, firm tannins. It has a solid, chunky character, although that is balanced by the black plum and berry fruits and serious acidity. Both for its weight and its structure, it should age for several more years., 92.0, 600.0
US, Family Reserve, The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crème de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years., 97.0, 625.0

Spain, Figuero Tinus, Toasty and black as midnight on the nose, this has mineral-driven, tight-grained oak, with a blackberry aroma that won't quit. It feels deep, dense and saturated on multiple levels, with black fruit flavors leading the charge, followed by clove and hickory accents. Warm, long and driving on the finish. Drink 2014–2020. Just over 100 cases and magnums made., 93.0, 599.0
France, , This wine is deceptive. At first smell and taste, it doesn't show much—its spice and green-fruit aromas are not at all obvious. It's when you roll it around your mouth, that all the layers of flavor emerge. It is powerful, rounded, but with a fine line of minerality that holds the whole wine on a knife edge. The wood is beautifully judged, the fruit just beginning to develop secondary aromas. Hold for several years., 95.0, 600.0

France, , There is a lightness about this vintage of Mouton Rothschild. It doesn't take away from its quality but does give the wine poise and an attractive lift. The wine is based on solid tannins, then the ripe fruit builds layers of fruitiness and freshness. It is not likely to be one of the longest-aging Moutons, but it will be delicious. Drink from 2020., 95.0, 600.0
Germany, Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese, Hugely sweet yet reasonably balanced given its enormous concentration, this is a tremendous example of the quality heights sweet Riesling can achieve. Golden raisin, dried apricots and candied pineapple all swirl together in a delicious haze of sugar-coma-inducing syrup that nevertheless goes down easily. Will age easily for decades., 97.0, 612.0
France, , A ripe wine, with a delicious citrus and pear character, sweet fruits and an edge of spice. Pineapple acidity gives both richness and freshness. The wine has both balance and final acidity., 93.0, 580.0
France, Marquis de Laguiche, This is a beautifully shaped wine that rises from a quiet opening. Muted and slightly closed up at this stage, it opens opulently but with balanced acidity and crispness, as well as richness and restrained power., 96.0, 596.0

Portugal, Very Old Single Harvest, Properly old gold in color, this is a wine from a single year, aged in casks. It's poised between amazing fruit and a wonderful velvet texture that is shot through with acidity. A feeling of lightness comes from the acidity that gives great freshness as well as complex flavors. It's ready to drink., 95.0, 588.0
Australia, Grange, This is dark and concentrated, as you might expect from Australia's most heralded wine. Oaky scents of maple syrup and vanilla frame hints of mint and superintense dark fruit. On the palate, it's a huge, tannic behemoth that needs 10 years of cellaring, but it delivers plenty of pleasure now in its ultraclean flavors of blackberries, baking spices and vanilla., 97.0, 600.0

Italy, Vigneto di Monte Lodoletta, Winemaker Romano Dal Forno fearlessly confronted the soggy 2002 vintage with high extraction techniques and barrique aging (36 months). This is an inky, dense wine (more syrupy than it is vinous) with black currant, peppermill, chocolate fudge and big firm wood tannins. It is so monolithic, a viable food match is virtually impossible. As always, Dal Forno straddles a fine line between brilliance and exaggeration., 90.0, 535.0

France, , Taut and mineral, this is currently a wine that is waiting to reveal its power and majesty. The fruit is on a tight rein of acidity, which only slowly opens up to show mango, pineapple, crisp citrus, layers of toast and a mouth-enveloping richness. Age for at least five years, preferably 10., 97.0, 574.0
France, , A tropical- fruited wine, full of toast and apricot and melon fruits. It is deliciously ripe and soft with the acidity lost in the richness. It is opulent and already a pleasure to drink., 94.0, 545.0
France, , A solidly structured wine, it is both elegant and intensely powerful. It is disclosing its fruitiness slowly, at the moment dense and concentrated. A restrained edge provides complexity and balance. It will need aging, so don't drink before 2022., 95.0, 550.0
France, Noblesse d'Or Brut Rosé, This new Champagne brand's rosé is soft, with a sweet strawberry flavor. It has a fine balance of acidity and ripe fruit, with a crisp finish despite the intruding sweetness., 86.0, 495.0
Australia, Hill of Grace Vineyard, This is a bold, full-flavored, authoritative example of Eden Valley Shiraz. Cool-climate notes of cracked pepper elegantly frame waves of blackberry fruit that are fresh and zingy, not cooked or confected. This is firmly structured and built for the cellar, yet the tannins are ripe, forming a silky web that supports the fruit on the prolonged finish. Drink 2012–2035., 96.0, 550.0
Hungary, Essencia, This famed Hungarian dessert wine never disappoints. An elegant nose of honey, apricot, butterscotch and spice is followed by a luxuriant, mouth-coating wave of satiny honey and apricot flavors, balanced by citrusy acidity. Complex, perfectly poised, it's a wine with both pedigree and charm—delicious when sipped alone or paired with a mild Roquefort or fruit., 95.0, 544.0
Italy, , The phenomenal 2010 vintage shows why this wine is considered Italy's top purebred Merlot. Revealing structure, finesse and mesmerizing depth, it delivers blackberries, currants, cedar, exotic spices and mocha alongside firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's well balanced with fantastic length and while it's delicious now, hold for more complexity. Drink 2015–2030., 97.0, 550.0
France, , A ripe, toasty wine, very buttery. It has rich, almost sweet yellow fruit balanced with a wonderful mineral texture. The wine, of course, is still very young, but shows its future as being rounded and opulent. The acidity that holds it all together shows in the finish., 97.0, 550.0
Germany, Hattenheimer Wisselbrunnen Beernauslese Gold Cap, Zesty on the nose, with whiffs of orange rind, lemon and pineapple, this bright, zippy beerenauslese counters laser-focused acidity with creamy honey and marmalade flavors. Pleasantly astringent, it finishes on a bracing pink-grapefruit note. It's delicious now, but its honeyed citrus palate should gain complexity and dimension over the next 5–10 years., 90.0, 510.0
Spain, Unico, Name and reputation get you only so far, as this underwhelming offering from a poor vintage proves. Compact stewy aromas of baked berry fruits and asphalt are the appetizer. A main course of chunky jammy stewy berry and prune flavors finishes with a desiccated essence. Unico is known to age for decades, but not this vintage. Drink now for what it's worth., 89.0, 500.0
Italy, , Dal Forno delivers one of the world's most impossibly rich and concentrated red wines. Using grapes sourced from the high-density Monte Lodoletta vineyard, this inky, dark expression oozes with syrupy tones of maraschino, dark chocolate fudge, cinnamon spice, crushed clove and barbecue smoke. In keeping with the wine's legendary reputation for long aging potential, the tannins are rock solid at the moment., 95.0, 530.0
France, , This is the big one, one of the most treasured white wine vineyards in the world. And the wine is magnificent, balanced with restrained power and style. Yellow fruits are shot through with acidity that conveys a nervy texture and an intense, concentrated character. This needs many years; don't drink before 2020., 95.0, 520.0
France, Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru, Despite its power, this is so elegant, showing tannins, minerality and generous flavors of black fruits, dark chocolate and spices. The smooth and rich surface belies the inner taut texture, showing how the wine will need many years to finally come round., 96.0, 525.0
Italy, Sorì Tildin, Aromas of crushed plum, asphalt, oak, toast, exotic spice and forest floor lead the nose. The palate delivers black cherry, mocha, licorice and mineral alongside bracing, tightly woven tannins that need time to unwind. Drink 2017–2031., 92.0, 500.0
Germany, Erbacher Marcobrunn Trockenbeerenauslese, This TBA shows an incredible likeness to Earl Grey tea, sweetened with honey and made subtly even more complex through the inclusion of dried stone fruits. It's rich and concentrated, not just sugary, but could use just a tiny bit more acidity to completely balance the finish. A decade or two of cellaring should see a more balanced wine in the end., 93.0, 500.0
Germany, Erbacher Marcobrunn Trockenbeerenauslese, Enticing scents of grapefruit zest and bees wax are fitting openers to this creamy, rich TBA full of luscious orange-marmalade flavor. Bright, brisk tangerine acidity adds freshness and levity to the palate, leading to a long, honeyed finish., 93.0, 500.0

US, , Here's a big, flashy, cult-style wine if ever there was one. It offers masses of blackberries, black currants, coffee, spices and new oak. Vastly rich, it defines the Harlan Estate style, although, in this vintage, perhaps not quite at its highest expression. Nonetheless the wine is fat and unctuous and immediately drinkable, thanks to refined tannins. Yet it should age effortlessly through 2018., 94.0, 500.0
France, Cristal Rosé Brut, Orange-pink in color, this a super-rich rosé. The flavors are of orange zest, citrus and red currants, with a beautiful contrast of hazelnuts. The texture, round and succulent, is still able to offer minerality and a crisp aftertaste., 95.0, 505.0

Australia, Bin 707, This Cabernet equivalent to Grange has exploded in price (I remember tasting the 1996 on release when it was $25 per bottle), but there's no questioning the quality. A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft. Brighter notes of red fruit emerge on the lengthy finish, which is dominated by sweet fruit and creamy lactones. Drink 2020–2030, and probably well beyond., 95.0, 500.0
France, , A big and powerful wine, with tannins that are compact and dense. The dryness of the tannins go right to the core, surrounded by chocolate, sweet fruit and dark berry flavors. The wine is well structured, big and bold, with plenty of firmness promising aging., 95.0, 500.0
France, Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru, This wine is just starting out, which explains the toast factor that currently dominates the nose and palate. As it opens, the opulent, ripe fruit from this great vineyard shows through in the form of powerful, and intense pineapple and apricot flavors that mingle in the tight texture. It will age for many years—start with at least six., 95.0, 500.0

Italy, Costa Russi, Costa Russi presents a dark wall of ripe fruit and an exotic spice shading that give momentum and power to the finish. There are also notes of plum, dark chocolate, tobacco, licorice and tar. The quality of the tannins is firm and polished; this should evolve over many years to come., 95.0, 495.0
Italy, Sorì Tildin, Elegant, fine and characterized by deep complexity, this celebrated bottling from Angelo Gaja offers dark nuances of plum, chocolate and dried tobacco, with delicate accents of ground licorice and herb. The long finish is powerful and generous. Drink after 2020., 95.0, 495.0
US, Red Wine, Ripe and flashy, offering tiers of cassis, chocolate and charry new oak flavors, wrapped in sweet, smooth tannins. Has an acidic bite midpalate that balances the lushness, and will add to the wine's cellar-worthiness. Defines sheer power, but never loses control. Best now and through 2017, at least., 96.0, 500.0
France, La Cabotte, This comes from high up in the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, from vines surrounding a small workers shed, the “cabotte.” It is the better of the two bottlings from this vineyard by Bouchard, although “better” here is like differentiating between two stars on top form. It has great poise, so although the richness is there, it is shot through with acidity and citric flavors that underline the huge, ripe fruit. Age for 10 years for best results., 96.0, 500.0
France, , A fine wine that offers power, generosity and also a chalky, mineral character. No wonder Montrachet is seen as the greatest grand cru—it has structure, concentration, delicious fruit and layers of complexity. It also needs to age. To drink this wine now would be more than a shame., 96.0, 500.0

Italy, Sorì San Lorenzo, There's always something magical about Gaja's Sorì San Lorenzo. It's the intensity and fullness of the wine that penetrates to the back of the palate and offers many long minutes of persistency on the finish. The bouquet is redolent of black fruit, leather, spice, tar, licorice and dried herb., 96.0, 495.0
Germany, Trockenbeerenauslese Goldlack, So incredibly thick and sweet it's almost chewy in texture, with aromas and flavors that feature a fascinating interplay of fresh and dried apricots, peach and citrus, kept lively by healthy acidity. The finish lasts for minutes; the wine should age well for decades., 97.0, 486.0
France, , The small Mazoyères-Chambertin Grand Cru creates structured wines with plenty of texture and tannins. This is brooding, firm and very concentrated, with its fruit set way behind the dark tannins and spice note. It will take at least 10 years to start to mature., 95.0, 475.0
France, , Still way too young, this is developing into a substantial and structured wine. Full of both fruit and tannins, it is dark and dense, very dry at this stage but with the most enticing perfumes. The Grand Cru, split between Chambolle-Musigny and Morey Saint-Denis, is known for its structure and this wine is a great example. Drink from 2020., 93.0, 463.0

Spain, Unico, Hailing from the hottest vintage in years, this is round, rubbery and showing sweet, rooty aromas of root beer, cola, mocha and stewed plum. Dense but soft, it has rubbery, savory flavors of barbecue sauce, herbal plum, tomato and carob. An earthy, loamy, chunky finish offers tobacco and baking spice accents. Drink through 2020., 91.0, 450.0
Portugal, Vintage, Perfectly mature, this Port's tannins have softened over the past 40-plus years, leaving it lushly textured and displaying rich fig and chocolate flavors. Finishes long, picking up a touch of almond to go with the fig, flavors Symington calls “Dow's hallmarks.” Drink now–2015, longer if you prefer very mature wines., 95.0, 467.0

France, , This is a wine for aging. The tannins are dense, very dry with a feel of extraction. It takes a while for the black currant fruit to show through, with acidity and freshness dominant. The wine is still settling, and time will bring the fruit into line with the tannins., 94.0, 455.0
Spain, Clon de la Familia, This is the granddaddy in the Emilio Moro portfolio, but the wine is so ripe and oaky it's syrupy-smelling. Maximum ripeness means it's a bit Port-like on the palate, with baked black-fruit flavors that finish soft and jammy. This brims with power, extraction and flavor but it's grasping for structure. Drink through 2019., 93.0, 450.0
France, , Silky wine, fresh and light, balanced with high acidity cutting through black berry fruits. The structure has some substance, but this is a light, aromatic wine, developing fast, already delicious, and only for medium-term aging., 93.0, 450.0
France, , This wine is perfumed with gorgeous fruit that contrasts with the strict minerality. The tannins under the fruit are severe, solid, dark and promising enormous potential. Concentrated even while it celebrates great fruit, it is going to last for many years. Drink from 2023., 97.0, 468.0

France, Ex Voto, This bottling from Guigal's own Hermitage holdings is incredibly rich and ripe (15.5% alcohol). In fact, it comes dangerously close to being overblown before the syrupy cherry fruit is reined back in by underlying spice and minerality. Expect that minerally edge to assert itself more with time in the cellar, making this a wine worth revisiting in 10 years' time., 94.0, 450.0

France, , A serious wine, filled with firm tannins, spiced with wood, and layered with bitter coffee as well as fruit. It certainly has power, the structure ready for long aging, firmly anchored in the dense character of this wine. It is a medium aging wine, 5–10 years., 94.0, 450.0

US, , Smells a bit minty and peppery, but once in the mouth, turns ultra-generous in black currant, chocolate-covered mint and spicy cedar flavors. Massive, yet refined and elegant, and even with the firm tannins, grows more charming as it warms in the glass. Very fine quality, and likely to hold for many years., 95.0, 450.0
France, , The wood element is important here, but it is based on a firm Cabernet Sauvignon structure, dry but rich tannins. The wine is a great success for the vintage, giving sweetness, ripe fruit that only shows light extraction, and dark plum and berry flavors. The feeling is of polished fruit and wood, rounded but always dense., 95.0, 450.0
Italy, Costa Russi, Costa Russi (a vineyard purchased by Gaja in 1967) produces a feminine wine with an emphasis on elegance and harmony, rather than power and succulence. Bright red fruit, smoke, cedar, cola and polished mineral notes create a beautiful embroidery of aromas and the wine's firm but composed tannins bring the mouth alive. Keep it in your cellar 10 years or more., 94.0, 445.0
Germany, Serrig Schloss Saarsteiner Eiswein, One of the palest icewines to come across our tasting table, this is an extraordinarily fine example, with great purity of fruit and incredible balance. Tangerine and pineapple flavors shine with pristine clarity from start to finish, making it very drinkable., 95.0, 448.0
France, La Mouline, How can a wine be this hugely concentrated, yet remain supremely elegant? Espresso, black olive and floral notes zoom from the glass, backed by layers of rich, creamy cherry fruit, making this a complex, complete wine.

Italy, Sorì Tildìn, Dense and concentrated in appearance, Sorì Tildìn (with 5% Barbera) is the plushest and roundest of Gaja's single-vineyard wines. Thanks to the quality of the fruit, the excellent vintage and 12 months of barrique, the final result is an austere and important wine with deep tones of black cherry, licorice, anise, tobacco and cedar. It closes after many long minutes with decisive tannins and cooling freshness. Drink after 2020., 95.0, 445.0
Germany, Wehlener Sonnenuhr Vat 59 Trockenbeerenauslese, So unctuous and decadently sweet that this is one of those TBAs that's best taken in very small sips. Dried apricot, candied pear and caramelized pineapple flavors are concentrated and intense, lingering sweetly on the long finish., 94.0, 440.0
France, , The balance of this wine is what makes it so impressive. Spice and yellow fruit intermingle effortlessly. There is a core of tight, coiled steel, like a spring, which gives minerality along with the richness. At the end, acidity lifts the wine, finishing with freshness as well as intensity., 97.0, 451.0
France, , There is a sense of pure juicy black-currant fruit that shoots through this great wine. With tannins that are firm while not a jot too much, the wine is crisp, packed with fruit and set for many years of aging. It is beautiful, fruity and intensely structured. Drink from 2027., 97.0, 450.0
Italy, Sorì San Lorenzo, You cannot not love this wine: layered and intense with extraordinary integrity of fruit, it offers supple flavors of dark fruit, spice, tobacco and chocolate.

Italy, Masseto, A perfect wine from a classic vintage, the 2007 Masseto (100% Merlot from a 17-acre vineyard of the same name) opens with an unabashedly opulent bouquet of delicious blackberry, cherry, chocolate, vanilla, exotic spice and cinnamon. Masseto excels both in terms of quality of fruit and winemaking and delivers plush, velvety tannins and an extra long, supple finish.

France, La Turque, This is breathtaking stuff, incredibly complex on the nose, where it features hints of vanilla, clove, cinnamon, cassis, pepper and asphalt. It would be a wine to sit and smell all day if it weren't so delicious to taste. Rich waves of cassis fruit cascade over the palate without losing complexity, buffered by incredibly supple tannins. The virtually endless finish confirms the quality. Drink now–2030+., 98.0, 450.0

Spain, Clon de la Familia, Luscious prune and blackberry aromas come with complex notes of graphite, toast and tobacco. The palate on this 80-case, high-end Tinto Fino is about as full as they come while still maintaining impeccable balance. Roasted berry, cassis and salty leather flavors are delicious but also challenging, while baked berry flavors, raw power and ripe tannins define the finish. Drink this outstanding Spanish wine from 2014 through 2024., 98.0, 450.0
Germany, Trockenbeerenauslese, Even in a flight of top BAs and TBAs, this one stood out. It's hugely sweet and viscous, yet also has amazingly fresh acids that really prolong the finish and promise decades—if not centuries—of cellaring. Golden raisin and dried apricot notes are true to type, and the wine's balance is impeccable., 97.0, 445.0
France, , Using grapes sourced from the greatest white-wine vineyard in Burgundy, this is huge, dense, very rich and complex. The balance already shows in the wine's acidity, ripe yellow fruit and round texture. Wood aging brings notes of spice and toast. This will age for many years., 94.0, 430.0
France, , Rich and full-bodied, the flavors of quince and pear are balanced by great acidity. It is a big, powerful wine that, with its tight fruit and steely background, promises long aging. The tropical fruits also need several years to show strongly. Drink from 2018., 94.0, 428.0
France, La Landonne, Dense and rich but also incredibly complex, long and elegant, this is a momumental Côte-Rôtie. It's darkly fruited and superripe, yet doesn't lose its essential sense of terroir, remaining marked by scents of pepper and espresso to go with the chocolate and cassis fruit. Velvety in texture, this is the one of Guigal's 2003 Côte-Rôties that demands a few years of cellaring. Drink 2010–2040., 99.0, 450.0

France, Fleur de Champagne Blanc de Blancs Brut, This is full, perhaps heavy, but certainly with a fine, powerful character. The acidity and the green-apple texture are at one with the white-fruit flavors, which gives extra richness to the wine. Just a hint of mineral can be detected., 89.0, 400.0

France, Clos de Vougeot, This feels old fashioned with its big, solid and dry tannins. This is very smoky and laden with wood; the fruit seems to be way behind the dark, firm structure. It's never going to be fruity—always firmly tannic., 89.0, 400.0

Spain, L'Ermita, Super pricey but this is a knock-your-socks-off wine with a gorgeous bouquet that shows not even a hint of syrup or jam. The palate is like a nova; it bursts with plum, blackberry and cinnamon. No harshness, not too tannic, and splendid on the finish, where toast and chocolate appear and stick around for a long time. It's 80% old-vines Garnacha and 20% Cabernet, and there just aren't enough superlatives to describe it. Only 300 cases made. Imported by Rare Wine Company., 98.0, 440.0
Italy, Sorì San Lorenzo, Always a standout among Gaja's five single-vineyard wines, Sorì San Lorenzo benefits from an excellent vintage to produce what will surely become a must-have bottle for collectors of Italian wine. There's enormous beauty and elegance here, backed by power and intensity with ripe fruit, spice, toasted nut and cola. It also shows impressive linearity and focus. Hold for 10 years or more., 99.0, 440.0
Italy, Sorì Tildìn, This is an elegant Nebbiolo-based wine and arguably the most feminine of Gaja's newest releases. There's extreme balance and sophistication evident in the focused aromas of wild berry, white licorice, pressed violets and polished stone. The mouthfeel is tight, firm and those tannins need at least 10 more years to soften in your cellar. Beautiful., 99.0, 440.0
France, , This beautiful wine is austere at this very young stage. But what pent-up power—the richness comes from glorious ripe fruit, tempered with a core of steel and wrapped with pure lemon, apricot and toast flavors. Age for 10 years at least., 97.0, 430.0
Italy, Costa Russi, Purchased by the Gaja family in 1967, the Costa Russi vineyard produces elegant expressions of Nebbiolo with beautifully saturated, sun-drenched flavors. Indeed, this vintage shows wild berry with beautiful background renderings of smoke and graphite. Five percent Barbera is added and the wine shows amazing harmony and sophistication with bright acidity and firm tannins. It will only become more beautiful in time., 95.0, 420.0
Italy, Lodovico, Aromas of graphite, black currant, plum, cedar, blue flowers and tobacco emerge from this full-bodied red. Made with Cabernet Franc and a drop of Petit Verdot, the structured palate offers blackberries, licorice, clove and a toasted note alongside velvety tannins. It shows great finesse, especially for the torrid 2011 vintage. Drink 2016–2026., 95.0, 419.0
France, Fleur de Champagne Blanc de Blancs Brut, A nutty aroma follows through to the mature palate of this distinguished Blanc de Blancs. It has a good element of acidity, toast and spice and an intense pear and mineral aftertaste., 91.0, 399.0

Spain, , Never let the price tag dictate perceived quality; you may be disappointed. This tart, choppy, clumsily extracted Tempranillo is a case in point. Where's the balance and mouthfeel? This is why we blind-taste; save your $350., 81.0, 354.0

Chile, Viñedo Chadwick, The price on this wine is laughable, but the quality is excellent. Earthy aromas of lead pencil, baked plum, cassis and black cherry include chocolate and minerality. The palate is rich, jammy and a touch stewy, with herbal blackberry, cassis, chocoalte and coffee flavors. Even more chocolate and licorice rise up on the long finish. Put this away until 2015, then drink through 2024., 92.0, 400.0
France, Clos de Vougeot, A perfumed wine that smells and tastes mature. While it still has some sweet strawberry fruit, secondary flavors of coffee, toast and mature acidity dominate. It is not likely to improve much with further keeping, but is a delectable Pinot Noir now., 92.0, 400.0
France, Les Forts de Latour, Mint aromas hint at the wood, but more important is the massive Merlot fruit that is an essential element in the blend. The result is a wine that blends richness and power with an initially severe character. Slowly it opens to reveal opulent blackberry jam flavors, immensely ripe., 95.0, 412.0
Portugal, Colheita Tawny, This is an astonishing wine for its age. It shines with fruit and with rich toffee flavors that are balanced by acidity. It's a warm, ripe wine, intense and concentrated. The dryness of such a long wood aging (the wine was only bottled in 2015) is really only a background to the richness., 96.0, 415.0
Portugal, Barca Velha, This is the latest release of Portugal's most iconic wine. It's made only in selected years (the last vintage was 2000) from Ferreira's Quinta da Leda in the Douro Superior. This new vintage is superb. It's a richly tarry wine laden with dark plum fruits and tannins that are just beginning to mature. It's a ripe and luscious, demanding attention, yet will still age for many years. Drink now, or hold until 2020., 99.0, 426.0
Australia, Hill of Grace Vineyard, Readers fortunate enough to latch onto a bottle of the fewer than 300 imported to the U.S. will find themselves with a super bottle of Shiraz that manages to deliver great flavor intensity without relying on excessive weight. Notes of cracked black pepper and herbal nuances add complexity to the liquorous blackberry aromas, building in spicy intensity through the anise-inflected finish. Approachable now, but should drink well through at least 2015., 93.0, 400.0
Chile, Viñedo Chadwick, Confident, smoky aromas of black fruits, quality oak and minerality set up a round, dense, smooth palate that's as elegant as things get in Chile. True Cabernet Sauvignon flavors are spicy, lightly herbal and suggest licorice, cassis and blackberry. On the finish, warm oak, menthol and medicinal flavors call for another few years in bottle. Best from 2016–2023., 93.0, 400.0
France, Brut Rosé, The beauty of Krug's rosé is the sense of bottle age, of that extra richness. That means the wine is not just the sum of its delicious red berry fruits. It's also the way the wine is rounded out, filled with secondary flavors, toast and almonds and a taut minerality. The aftertaste is taut, dry, seamless, complex., 94.0, 400.0
Germany, Monzinger Frühlingsplätzchen Trockenbeerenauslese, Honeycomb and crushed rocks, preserved peach and citrus rind mix lavishly in this creamy, feather-light TBA. A bracing strike of acidity jolts through the midpalate, but finds ease in layers of mouth coating honey and wax that meander through an endlessly lingering finish. Stunning now, but will evolve well for decades to come., 94.0, 400.0
Italy, Redigaffi, One of Italy's most acclaimed Merlots, this concentrated wine opens with scents of black currants, cedar, sage and espresso. The firmly structured but polished palate delivers dried black cherry, black pepper, coffee and licorice alongside a backbone of velvety tannins. Drink 2017–2022., 94.0, 400.0

Germany, Rosa-Goldlack Beerenauslese, With scents of dried apricots and superconcentrated pear nectar, one sniff suggests this is going to be a sumptuously sweet treat. And it is. Pear, melon and spice flavors linger elegantly on the finish, ending long and sweet., 93.0, 395.0
France, , A marvelously intense wine, the Chardonnay singing with light toast and acidity. The wine has layers of green apple, spice, a tight texture and orange zest highlights. Age for at least seven years., 97.0, 410.0
France, , With three acres out of 36 in this Grand Cru, Faiveley is one of the larger proprietors. The wine is firm and structured with solid tannins, while black fruits give acidity and freshness to this massive wine. Drink from 2020., 93.0, 391.0
France, , Considerable wood flavors mask the ripe fruits at this stage. A rich, perfumed wine, it will bring huge, ripe flavors of pineapple and peach, as well as a powerful toasty character. Give it until 2018., 93.0, 391.0
France, , A glorious outpouring of beautifully crafted Chardonnay, opulent but tightly mineral. The ripe apple and pear character has a delicate, elegant squeeze of lime, while the whole wine is underpinned by wood. No doubt for long-term aging., 98.0, 411.0

Italy, Riserva, Immediately, you know you are before a great Brunello with bright fruit aromas backed by forest floor, balsam notes, bramble, blue flowers, red apple and mint.

France, Le Mesnil Blanc de Blancs, The fabled Salon's latest release is much riper and softer than the great steely 1996 vintage. This suggests it is likely to be ready to drink soon.

France, , For many, this vineyard offers the purest form of Pinot Noir, a seductive, opulent style, with rich fruits dominant, the powerful acidity deceptively sweet. Add to this a tight, firm, smoke-and-toast tannic structure, and this is not only a fine wine now, but one with long-term potential. Keep for at least six years., 95.0, 380.0
Germany, Kiedrich Gräfenberg Eiswein, Perhaps a step behind Weil's other supersweet 2009s, this eiswein remains a prodigious effort. The candied pineapple and golden raisin notes are so intense, so concentrated that they're almost painful to taste, lingering virtually forever on the finish., 94.0, 376.0
France, Legend Vintage, With only 795 bottles produced, this is a special treat. Although it's ready to drink now, it has the structure and pedigree to age for decades.

France, Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru, With his family based in Puligny-Montrachet, Olivier Leflaive knows a thing or two about the grand crus of his village.

Portugal, Colheita Tawny, There is a great balance between acidity and impressively fresh fruit considering the age of this venerable Port. Of course there are many flavors from the wood aging, but they are combined with orange marmalade, fig and raisin flavors in a riot of complex flavors that have created a very great wine. It comes from a year that was not generally declared as a vintage., 95.0, 375.0
Germany, Kiedrich Gräfenberg Beerenauslese, Initial whiffs of nuts and bruised apple blow away, revealing radiant aromas of marmalade and honey on this unctuous yet delicate wine.

France, La Richemonne Cuvée Ultra Premier Cru, Made from grapes sourced from vines planted in 1902, this is a huge, powerful, minerally wine.

Germany, Kiedrich Gräfenberg Beerenauslese, A sweet trail of orange marmalade percolates through this succulently sweet wine.

France, , A beautiful wine, with the firmest tannins surrounded by perfumed fruit. It is dense, of course, but this density is balanced with great elegance, blackberry fruits, sweetness and final juicy acidity. The wine is structured, a powerhouse of concentration while preserving this complete style., 98.0, 380.0
France, , A smooth, velvet textured wine, piled high with sweet, ripe flavors. There is fine, opulent concentration here, impressive density, and a solid, tannic core. While it is not as powerful as some vintages from this estate, it certainly suggests the ability to age 5–6 years and more., 93.0, 360.0
France, , For a Grand Cru from Vosne-Romanée, this is a wine on the light side, its tannins soft and dominated by new-wood flavors. That said, it is still a fine wine, packed with ripe fruit and fresh acidity. The structure floats over the fruit; a few months and it may fatten out., 91.0, 350.0
France, Fleur de Champagne Rosé Brut, All raspberries and red currants, this is a delicious, instantly approachable wine.

Romania, Dulce, This collectible botrytis Riesling grown on the banks of the Danube in Romania is very concentrated, with heady flavors of honey, caramel and apricot and a nutty overall character. The finish is crisp and there's some acidity to keep the wine light on the palate. An unusual dessert wine and perhaps not for every wine lover, but definitely worthy of tasting and discussion. Imported by Vidalco International, LLC., 85.0, 320.0
France, Petit Monts Premier Cru, Big and bold with great strawberry and red cherry flavors, this wine has all the elements of dense fruit, intense acidity and rich tannins.

France, , This may be from the exceptional vintage of 2003, but Château Margaux remains true to form. First and foremost, it is a refined, elegant wine, with complex layers of flavors. But, yes, the hot summer is there the dense, dry tannins, but somehow they seem to float through the wine rather than sitting heavily in the middle. Acidity and freshness come to finish, giving the wine a delicious lift. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates., 96.0, 360.0

Italy, Riserva, This opens with aromas of oak, toast, licorice, coconut and sugared plum. The taut palate offers dried cherry, star anise and a green note of powdered sage but not a lot of fruit richness. Raspy tannins leave a tongue-drying finish., 87.0, 325.0
France, Belle Epoque Rosé, With just the right amount of toasty age, this is gorgeous. Its strawberry note is woven into its rich texture, with a flavor of fresh croissant and a final burst of acidity. It could age, but why wait?, 94.0, 350.0
Germany, Erdener Prälat Goldkap Beerenauslese, Exuberant floral tones persist from nose to finish in this luminously sweet Riesling. It's feather light on the palate, yet pineapple and mango flavors are unctuous and concentrated. A spray of tangerine acidity extends the finish endlessly., 94.0, 350.0
US, , This shows the tightly knit tannins of Spring Mountain, and is unapologetic about them, demanding that you cellar this wine. It's very finely constructed, with brisk acidity and a firm, grounding minerality below the intensely concentrated core of blackberry and cassis flavors. It should hit its stride in 8-10 years and go for well beyond that., 94.0, 350.0
Spain, Viña El Pison, This single-vineyard Rioja is smooth, pure and elegant. Aromas of lemon peel, tobacco, cookie dough, marzipan, spiced plum and cassis set up a lush, deep palate with saturated flavors of wild raspberry, ripe plum, chocolate and fig. Compelling notes of licorice and chocolate are accompanied by a touch of youthful heat and burn on the finish. Best from 2015 through 2025., 94.0, 350.0
US, , Made in the Lokoya style, which is darkly colored, full bodied, tannic and dense in mountain fruit. A spicy oak tone joins with massive blackberry, cassis and violet flavors to make this wine delicious from the start. It's very tannic and needs a great deal of time. Begin to enjoy this wine in 2016, and it should go far longer than that., 94.0, 350.0
US, , Bitter tannins lock this wine down in mouth-numbing astringency. Below the tannins is incredibly pure fruit, by way of blackberry and plum flavors. It has firm minerality, like a lick of stone, while oak aging brings its own flavor profile as well as additional wood tannins. This is nowhere near ready, so give it at least eight years in the cellar., 94.0, 350.0
US, , The style of this wine may not be for everyone, but there's no doubt that it's a great success for its type. Dry and full bodied, it shows intensely concentrated blackberry, cassis and mineral flavors, wrapped into huge, thick tannins. This absolutely requires aging; begin drinking it in 2016, but even then, it will be just starting to mellow., 94.0, 350.0
Italy, La Mattonara Riserva, This has all of the makings of a cult classic to come. It has pedigree—one of the founding winery partners is linked to the Quintarelli legacy—quality, elegance and a long aging future ahead. Dark, dense and thickly extracted, this is redolent of sweet tobacco, savory spice, cola, teriyaki sauce, black fruit and currant. The finish is long and streamlined, showing a touch of heat and muscle., 94.0, 350.0
Spain, Prestigio Pago de las Solanas, Hard to believe the price on this. Yes, it's a perfectly good aged Ribera, but special it isn't. Bricky and roasted on the nose, with spiced cherry and plum aromas. The palate is healthy and comfortable, with cola, cherry and licorice flavors. Vanilla and length define the finish. Too regular to recommend at $325., 88.0, 325.0
Australia, Astralis, Astralis has become one of Australia's top collectibles, and Roman Bratasiuk's 2005 version is once again top-shelf stuff. It's full-bodied and rich without being over the top, balancing dark-chocolate-covered blackberries and blueberries with more complex savory notes (spice, grilled meat). While it's a big, hulking wine at first, the finish shows great elegance and finesse, ending with silky tannins. Best from 2014. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited., 95.0, 350.0
France, , With its superripe, jammy fruit, this is lush and opulent. It does have a fine structure as well as bitter chocolate and dark tannins. A hugely powerful wine., 95.0, 350.0
Italy, Costa Russi, Darker, richer and earthier than Gaja's Barbaresco, picking up notes of coffee, vanilla and toast as well. Yet on the palate there's wonderfully bright cherry-raspberry fruit and masses of lush, velvety tannins that will give this wine plenty of life in the cellar. Drink 2012–2030., 95.0, 350.0
France, Legend Vintage, For any serious fan of Rivesaltes, this is a must-have example. Aromas of dried apricot, toasted hazelnut, fig, ginger, sweet spice and candied orange rind fill the bouquet, while the mouth is silky and balanced—sweet and heady without being cloying. All of the aromas transition onto the palate alongside accents of walnut skins and shiitake mushroom. Soft salinity makes the long finish even more mouthwatering. Drink now, or continue to age. There are 869 bottles produced., 95.0, 350.0
France, Brut, This Krug vintage is showing some maturity, especially from its toast aroma. But certainly not too much maturity, because on the palate the fruit remains young at heart, a crisp burst of freshness coming through the more mature acidity. All the elements are in balance, making a finely shaped wine, which impresses as much from its elegance as from its richness., 95.0, 350.0

Italy, Sorì Tildìn, Filled with intoxicating perfume reminiscent of dried spices, fine leather, exotic woods, then delivers bold black cherry, plum and Asian spice flavors tightly wrapped in a velvety blanket of tannin.

Italy, Sorì San Lorenzo, Perhaps less nuanced than the Sorì Tildìn, but more powerful, with round, mouthfilling flavors and firm tannins. Hints of tobacco and vanilla add complexity to rich plum and black cherry notes, finshing with a lovely touch of anise. Drink 2015–2030 and beyond., 95.0, 350.0

France, L'Ermite Ermitage, The 2006 L'Ermite boasts a wonderfully fragrant bouquet of cracked pepper, beef blood and plummy fruit, but is a full-bodied, powerful expression of Syrah on the mouth, bulging with crushed stone and espresso nuances.

Spain, Tinus, Everything about this stately Ribera heavyweight impresses. The nose is outright oaky, so expect derivative aromas of toast, clove, cinnamon and spice to go with black-fruit scents. This remains firm, tannic and tightly wrapped, with massive blackberry, chocolate and toast flavors. Peppery spice, brooding mixed-berry flavors and mouth-coating tannins endow a finish that signals that this has many good years ahead of it. Drink from 2018–2032., 96.0, 351.0
France, Brut, Although the aromas are toasty, the flavors are still so fresh, rich, complex. This is a wonderful expression of taut minerality, pure citrus zest and then a wood-toast character that gives the wine both richness and sophistication. Given the fresh, intense fruit, this will certainly age for many years., 96.0, 350.0
France, Bâtard-Montrachet, Mineral, steel and toast set this impressive, well-structured wine on to the road for aging. Behind this initially severe, very young exterior is the richest yellow and white fruit, exuding power, concentration and density. Give it 6–8 years and many more., 96.0, 350.0

US, , The price is prerelease; it will soar on the aftermarket. This is very great Harlan. It pours dark and saturated, and the tannins are big and sturdy, not aggressive, but sweet and finely ground. Still, they give a hardness to the immaculately ripe fruit that mandates cellaring. The flavors of currants, blackberries, plums, chocolate and cedar are lush, deep and long-lasting, but just a part of the balanced appeal of this young wine. It really defines the exquisite tension between power and elegance. Best after 2008, then for many years., 98.0, 350.0
France, , This is a splendid wine. Yes, it is more powerful than the usual aristocratic Lafites,  but it still manages to retain a special air of great elegance and presence.
