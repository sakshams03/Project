1. The data extracted as alreay said contains redundant enteries which is taken care in this section.
2. The file wineReport.csv contains that redundant data which is removed by the jar file names as string_count.jar.
3. Again the jar rank.jar tells the various possible ranks that the wines can have.
4. The problem with string_count.jar is that the data is sorted in lexical order with respect to country name which is not desired.
