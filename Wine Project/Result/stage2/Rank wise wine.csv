France, , This is the first vintage of a wine that used to be called Laville Haut-Brion. It is ripe and opulent with exotic fruits and generosity, very open, very rich. Pineapple, yellow fruits and toast are all present., 94.0, 1000.0
US, Reserve, This is nearly perfect, a massive, monumental wine whose sheer power is matched only by its grace and refinement. The flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, buttered toast and cedar flood the mouth, tightly controlled by firm tannins and good acidity. Decant for several hours if you open it now, but better to give it 6–10 years in the bottle., 99.0, 100.0
France, Non-Dosé Brut, Very intense, very nervy wine, living on a thin wire of grapefruit and other citrus flavors but much more about pure structure. The aftertaste shows great concentration., 89.0, 100.0
US, Litton Estate Vineyard, This is the best of the winery's new releases, both for drinking now and for cellaring. Combines power and elegance, with upscale flavors of cherries, currants, cola, rhubarbs, dried herbs and oak, wrapped into devastatingly rich tannins and a perfect touch of acidity. Should age well for 10 years., 98.0, 100.0
Spain, Calmo Vino de Lágrima Nocturno, Big grapy aromas of blackberry and cassis are rather heavy and flat. This has a tannic abrasive mouthfeel in which nothing is smooth. Borderline overripe flavors of baked plum and blackberry finish chocolaty and with baking-spice flavors., 88.0, 100.0
US, Five Sisters, This important Pinot Noir is expensive, but it is absolutely worth a search. It's not a single-vineyard wine, but a blend of various blocks from the cooler southern part of the valley. Oak, to the tune of 70% new, is very strong in char and vanilla, but way stronger is the fruit itself, which is exemplary and stunning. Raspberries, cherries and strawberries just begin to describe it, with all sorts of spice and earth complexities. Stuns with purity, complexity and sheer delicious power. Great now, and will easily develop over the next 6–8 years., 97.0, 100.0
US, Cloudy's Vineyard, Ultra-rich, with chocolate-infused dark berry flavors, splashed with cassis and accented with smoky new oak. Although the wine, which is 100% Cabernet, is totally dry, it's soft, which accentuates the alcohol, making it taste a bit hot and unbalanced., 87.0, 100.0
France, , Such a generous and ripe wine, with a dark core of tannins surrounded by opulent fruit. Black fruits, coffee, very concentrated flavors, a powerhouse of structure and richness. The warmth of the wine is palpable, as is the aging potential., 97.0, 1100.0
Italy, Oreno, No doubt you will very much enjoy this super Tuscan blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese. The wine is rich, smooth and opulent: The quality of the fruit is also excellent with background shadings of black mineral, mature cherry, clove, rum cake, smoked ham and cola., 96.0, 100.0
US, Estate Grown, This has strong acidity giving a sour candy taste to the raspberry and cherry flavors. The oak overlay is just fine, the texture is silky, and the finish is dry, but that acidity will likely never go away., 86.0, 100.0
US, Rennie Reserve, What a wonderful wine. So pure, so fine and so Bordeaux-esque, like a fine young Margaux that needs time. Made from 100% Cabernet grapes, it shows classic blackberry and black currant flavors, beautifully oaked, with smooth, polished tannins and a fleshy mouthfeel. A feminine wine, it has great charm now, and should develop in the bottle for many years., 95.0, 100.0
US, Collector's Reserve, Made in a superripe way that will appeal to some, this Cab has notes of raisins and prunes, as well as pronounced sweet oak. It's fully dry, and turns a bit hot on the finish., 85.0, 100.0
Italy, Ornellaia, The 2007 Ornellaia is a masterpiece blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and a tiny element of Petit Verdot. The intensity and purity are outstanding and the wine delivers beautiful notes of chocolate, black cherry, leather, cedar and spice. It's a big, modern expression that closes long with luscious softness and opulent fruit. Hold 10 years or more., 99.0, 200.0
Argentina, No. 55, Hands down, this is the finest Pinot Noir from South America that I've ever tasted, and that includes Chile, Argentina and anyplace else. Italy's Piero Incisa della Rocchetta of Sassicaia fame started this project in 2004, and it's now finding a groove. This wine is as elegant as Burgundy but as full of flavor as something from California. The color is rosy, the aromas beguiling, and the meeting of oak and fruit just perfect. Terrific for contemplating on its own or with food. Versatility should be its middle name., 94.0, 100.0
US, Solo Uno, Exotic pepper and hearty spices lead on this asserive wine from Macari. In the mouth, its earthy pepper and classic fruit flavors are touched with a smoky spin that add a a slight bitterness to the wine. Cellar it or pair it with grilled lamb or steak., 84.0, 100.0
Austria, Ried Loibenberg Smaragd, Wet earth, rain-wet stones, damp moss, wild sage and very ripe pear make for a complex opening. Further sniffs reveal more citrus: both juice and zest of lemon. The palate still holds a lot of leesy yeast flavors but its phenolic richness is tempered by total citrus freshness. This is still tightly wound; leave it so it can come into its own. The warming resonance on the palate suggests it has a long future. Drink from 2019., 94.0, 1100.0
France, , A big, rich wine, showing its gorgeous fruit easily. But with a core of dryness, the ripest apricots touched by caramel, it should age well over many years. There is intense power here, still hidden by the youth of the wine, but with final concentration., 98.0, 200.0
France, Palmes d'Or Rosé Brut, The Palmes d'Or rosé is always distinctive, not always for the good. However, this 2003 vintage shows well, with ripe cherry flavors, yeast and a soft, open texture. The acidity adds a crisp lemon zest aftertaste., 88.0, 200.0
US, Insignia, Tasted in October, 2007, the wine was mute, offering little aromatically except for teasing notes of blackberries and oak. That shyness extended to the taste, where strong, hard tannins provide an almost impenetrable coat of armor to what's inside. But right down the middle of the palate is a deep, intensely powerful stream of perfectly ripened cassis that's all the proof you need of ageability. This is a magnificently structured young wine, reminiscent of a fine young Pauillac. Best after 2012, and should have another decade after that, at least., 97.0, 200.0
US, Reserve, The very tannic '05 reserve is a blend of Petit Verdot, Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc. It's fleshy and rich in blackberry, cassis and tobacco flavors, with lots of new toasty oak, and there's something meaty, like ground hamburger with a splash of tamari. Utterly delicious and very fine, this low-production bottling should evolve over many years., 93.0, 100.0
France, Orgueil de France Brut, Heavy-handed Champagne, and rather overblown. The fruit has flavors of ripe apples, with strong hints of sweetness from the dosage., 83.0, 100.0
France, , Here's an impressive wine that is so ripe and with great structure. It is a major wine with a dark complex texture and the finest acidity. The wine is very complete, all the elements in place from the black fruits to the tannins to the hints of wood aging. Now at the top of the tree in Saint-Emilion's classification, the wine will take years to mature. Drink from 2027., 96.0, 200.0
France, , Solid, very structured, packed with dense and dry tannins. There is a core of acidity and darkness that gives the wine a brooding, powerful character. At this stage, it seems austere although it does have the weight of fruit typical of the year., 96.0, 1200.0
Spain, Prestigio Pago de las Solanas, Open-cut oak, blackberry and chocolate are the opening shots in this plump, ripe, full-bodied red that is slightly tannic and chewy but impressive due to solid plum, cherry and vanilla flavors. Delivers commendable RdD quality, but $300 is shockingly expensive., 89.0, 300.0
France, , A big, powerful wine that sums up the richness of the vintage. It is densely fruity, spicy with an enormous black plum and berry fruit character to go with the acidity. It's concentrated while still showing such wonderfully pure fruit. The aging potential is immense., 99.0, 2300.0
US, La Joie, Massive essence of Cabernet Sauvignon, a triumph. Shows huge waves of blackberries, black currants and cassis, dark chocolate, earthy minerals and considerable oak, which is tasteful and unobtrusive, With its dryness and perfect balance, it will easily negotiate the years. Should be fine well past the year 2020., 98.0, 300.0
US, , One sip is all it takes to understand that this is a vital, impressive and possibly profound wine. A blend of 96% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, it displays the voluptuous richness of a Heidi Barrett wine, but also shows a firmness of character and a structural dryness that elevate it. Exceptionally flavorful in blackberries and cherries, it has tantalizing hints of herbs, olive tapenade and, of course, intensely fine oak. Drink now–2016., 95.0, 200.0
Australia, Cyril Henschke, From a somewhat difficult vintage, Stephen and Prue Henschke have turned out a wonderful Cab. Eucalyptus, tobacco and cherry aromas lead the way, followed by flavors that add a deep undercurrent of cassis. It's a big, thickly textured wine, with a long, berry-inflected finish. Not that tannic, it should nevertheless drink well through at least 2015., 92.0, 100.0
France, , Located in the northern end of Chambolle-Musigny, Bonnes Mares shows much of the same structure as Morey-Saint-Denis. This 2010 has so much weight and concentration, and it bears red fruit flavors and bright acids. It has a tannic side as well, which promises that this wine will age., 97.0, 300.0
Italy, Vigna Serè, Labeled as “air-dried sweet red wine” instead of its traditional name “Recioto,” this is indeed a powerful and generous wine. It boasts huge density and superintense aromas of blackberry, oak spice and tobacco. Keep it for your cellar., 94.0, 200.0
Spain, Prior Terrae, Mature, with tomato and dill aromas prior to severe cherry tomato, rhubarb and vanilla flavors. At all points the wine places zest before richness, acid before body. And while it has its aged, old-world virtues, it fails to share much love along the way., 84.0, 200.0
France, , The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging. At this stage, wood shows through the fruit, but the texture is so rich and opulent that it should easily become integrated., 96.0, 1300.0
US, Le Desir, Extremely tannic at the age of five years, and that astringency accentuates the dryness, making the wine austere and distant. It has a dense, complex core of blackberries, coated with immaculately fine, sweet oak. Feels important and dramatic, but too young. Begs to be housed in a good cellar for a good eight years., 95.0, 300.0
Spain, Unico, Name and reputation get you only so far, as this underwhelming offering from a poor vintage proves. Compact stewy aromas of baked berry fruits and asphalt are the appetizer. A main course of chunky jammy stewy berry and prune flavors finishes with a desiccated essence. Unico is known to age for decades, but not this vintage. Drink now for what it's worth., 89.0, 500.0
Portugal, Adelaide, Named after Doña Antónia Adelaide Ferreira, who created Quinta do Vallado (and many other quintas) in the 19th century, this complex wine comes from a 100-year-old vineyard. Its concentration is immense, tannins solid, but at the same time the black cherry and dark plum flavors float over everything, leaving richness but also freshness. Worth aging for five years., 93.0, 200.0
Italy, Nei Cannubi, Elegant and supple upfront, then hits you with masses of rich, soft tannins on the finish that alleviate any initial concerns about ageability. Aromas and flavors run the gamut from earth and tobacco, to cherry and plum, to cedar and vanilla. Drink 2010–2020., 91.0, 100.0
Italy, Riserva, Immediately, you know you are before a great Brunello with bright fruit aromas backed by forest floor, balsam notes, bramble, blue flowers, red apple and mint. The presence of wood is all but invisible and the wine sings true to its territory and tradition. The wine's natural acidity and intensity promise a long and glorious aging future before it., 96.0, 400.0
France, Dom Perignon Rosé, This is a full-blown, opulent, decadent wine that is packed with wonderful strawberry and ripe fruit flavors. It's at its peak now; it's a generous, delicious glass of wine that overflows with ripe flavors., 94.0, 300.0
France, Les Petits Monts Premier Cru, This is from vines owned by Véronique Drouhin. With a tight bite of plum, tannin and smoky wood,the wine has a young structure, the color still tinged with purple, finely balanced with fresh acidity. For aging., 92.0, 200.0
France, La Cabotte, This comes from high up in the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, from vines surrounding a small workers shed, the “cabotte.” It is the better of the two bottlings from this vineyard by Bouchard, although “better” here is like differentiating between two stars on top form. It has great poise, so although the richness is there, it is shot through with acidity and citric flavors that underline the huge, ripe fruit. Age for 10 years for best results., 96.0, 500.0
Australia, Grange, This is dark and concentrated, as you might expect from Australia's most heralded wine. Oaky scents of maple syrup and vanilla frame hints of mint and superintense dark fruit. On the palate, it's a huge, tannic behemoth that needs 10 years of cellaring, but it delivers plenty of pleasure now in its ultraclean flavors of blackberries, baking spices and vanilla., 97.0, 600.0
France, Legend Vintage, With just shy of 1,000 bottles produced, this will be hard to find. Dried fruit flavors of raspberry and red plum dominate the nose and mouth, while notes of sweet mulled spice, clove-pricked orange rind, pepper, walnut skin and bittersweet cocoa glimmer throughout. Full and rich but lively, with medium acidity and a zippiness to the finish. Enjoyable now, but this will benefit from another 5–10 years in the cellar., 93.0, 300.0
Germany, Monzinger Frühlingsplätzchen Trockenbeerenauslese, Honeycomb and crushed rocks, preserved peach and citrus rind mix lavishly in this creamy, feather-light TBA. A bracing strike of acidity jolts through the midpalate, but finds ease in layers of mouth coating honey and wax that meander through an endlessly lingering finish. Stunning now, but will evolve well for decades to come., 94.0, 400.0
France, Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru, This wine is just starting out, which explains the toast factor that currently dominates the nose and palate. As it opens, the opulent, ripe fruit from this great vineyard shows through in the form of powerful, and intense pineapple and apricot flavors that mingle in the tight texture. It will age for many years—start with at least six., 95.0, 500.0
France, , The palate opens slowly, offering an initial citrus character, followed by wood and then, finally, wonderfully rich, but taut fruit. There is still a toast character here, with apricots and pear on top of the citrus, but it is still only just developing. In 10–15 years, it will be a magnificent wine., 98.0, 800.0
France, , This wine is deceptive. At first smell and taste, it doesn't show much—its spice and green-fruit aromas are not at all obvious. It's when you roll it around your mouth, that all the layers of flavor emerge. It is powerful, rounded, but with a fine line of minerality that holds the whole wine on a knife edge. The wood is beautifully judged, the fruit just beginning to develop secondary aromas. Hold for several years., 95.0, 600.0
Argentina, Colección, Clean and full for starters, with big berry aromas and hints of freshly poured tar as well as minerality. The palate is pure and hits the nail on the head in terms of feel. Flavors of blackberry and plum are dark and generous. Finishes with pepper, espresso and chocolate. Very good wine for the price., 89.0, 10.0
France, , A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit. It has more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual, giving intense black currant flavors with enticing acidity balanced by the sweetness of the fruit. Ripe swathes of this opulent fruit are also elegant and structured., 98.0, 1900.0
Chile, Viñedo Chadwick, Confident, smoky aromas of black fruits, quality oak and minerality set up a round, dense, smooth palate that's as elegant as things get in Chile. True Cabernet Sauvignon flavors are spicy, lightly herbal and suggest licorice, cassis and blackberry. On the finish, warm oak, menthol and medicinal flavors call for another few years in bottle. Best from 2016–2023., 93.0, 400.0
Italy, Messorio, French oak, coconut, cassis, menthol and coffee aromas lead the nose of this structured red. Made entirely from Merlot, it's densely concentrated, offering mature plum, black currant, dried sage, anise and espresso flavors. Firm, close-grained tannins give the finish grip. Drink 2018–2025., 92.0, 300.0
US, Gravelly Meadow, From the winery's most pebbly five-acre section of vineyard atop Diamond Mountain, this is dark black-purple in color. The tannins are soft but powerful, eager to age through 2025–2027, while the fruit lies on the currant and plum side of things, with a bit of cedar lurking through., 91.0, 200.0
US, Quarter Moon Vineyard, There's a bubble-gummy, almost Beaujolais quality to this Pinot, which spent 15 months in 3/4 new French oak. It's rude now, with oaky, grapey flavors of black raspberry marmalade and Dr. Pepper cola. While it's dry and crisp and interesting, it's awkward. Is it an ager? Here's where crystal balls are required. Try between 2011–2013., 90.0, 100.0
France, Chateau D'Ampuis, Smoky and slightly bacony on the nose, but also quite cedary. The lavish oak is even more apparent in the mouth, where cedar and vanilla flavors take charge. It's supple, easy to drink and a very enjoyable wine, but the Cote-Rotie distinctiveness needs time to emerge. Try in 2008., 89.0, 110.0
Italy, Borgianni, Tight and muscular, with earthy, leathery aromas. Rich plum and berry fruit carries the palate, followed by a full-bodied finish. A well-balanced wine that's spry on the tongue and forceful, but not overdone., 88.0, 10.0
US, , Fragrant, showing cascades of violets, caramelized new oak, sweet cherry pie, cocoa and cassis aromas. In the mouth, it's unctuous, and floods the palate with sweet, savory flavors. Has a youthful jamminess right now, which will melt off and refine as time goes by. Such is the elegance and balance that cellaring it for 20 years will be no problem. This is the best Rubicon ever., 98.0, 110.0
Spain, Son Negre, Heavily oaked and loaded down with butter and resin, this is a wine for those infatuated with the obscure. The blend is 90% Callet and 10% Fogoneu, and don't ask us to give you the history of these Mallorcan grapes. Suffice it to say that this wine is broad, a bit stewy and very different. It's not heavy like an anchor but it has its chunky shoulder pads to deal with. Only 25 cases made., 88.0, 110.0
Italy, Modà, Soft, supple and seductive, Modà is a simple wine that is propped up by notes of mature cherry fruit, spice and tobacco. It's easy in the mouth, with a rich, velvety texture., 87.0, 10.0
Chile, Viñedo Chadwick, The price on this wine is laughable, but the quality is excellent. Earthy aromas of lead pencil, baked plum, cassis and black cherry include chocolate and minerality. The palate is rich, jammy and a touch stewy, with herbal blackberry, cassis, chocoalte and coffee flavors. Even more chocolate and licorice rise up on the long finish. Put this away until 2015, then drink through 2024., 92.0, 400.0
US, Padrone Proprietary Red Wine, Marks a welcome return to the magnificence of the 2002, although more recent vintages haven't exactly been slouches. The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency. Beautiful now, and should slowly develop for many years., 97.0, 110.0
Italy, , Despite the obvious quality of this wine—obvious in its vibrant ruby color and full bouquet of berry and spice aromas—there's a tiny touch of something pungent that recalls kerosene or alcohol. The structure is firm and solid without being bulky and it delivers flavors of small berry fruit., 87.0, 110.0
US, Family, Acidity, the kind that makes the tastebuds bristle, is what makes this semi-sweet Riesling a success. Without it, the ripe apricot, pineapple, peach and honey flavors would be flat and simple. With it, the wine is bright and succulent. A sweet, sugar-glazed ham will be a match made in heaven., 86.0, 10.0
Italy, , This is the wine that made Angelo Gaja a household name worldwide. Made according to Barbaresco tradition, the wine reveals itself slowly at first and doles out small aromas of wild berry, licorice, root beer, smoke and graphite that become magically more intense with time in the glass. The acidity, tannic factor and overall sophistication show harmony and masterful balance. Hold until 2018, at least., 97.0, 210.0
France, , With its concentrated yellow fruits, this is already a powerful wine. It is packed with acidity, toast, peach flavors and minerality, starting out as a gorgeously rich wine from a ripe vintage. Of course, it will age over many years; open in 10 years., 98.0, 410.0
Chile, Taita Wisdom in Wine Marchigue Vineyard, This Cabernet-led blend is Montes' new icon wine from Marchigue in the Colchagua Valley. It is ripe, warm, leathery and earthy, with aromas of aged cheese, tobacco, raisin and cedar. The mouth is hefty and bold, with a mix of coffee and herbal flavors as well as cassis and blackberry. The finish is heavy and a bit raisiny, with depth and density. Drink now through 2015., 91.0, 300.0
US, Galitzine Vineyard, Quilceda Creek's Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon opens with a dense, exotic and luxurious nose: a mix of roasted coffee, dark fruit and Asian spice. At first it's quite dense and unyielding, but it opens slowly over a period of days—not hours—remaining dense and compact, with a remarkable array of dark fruits and barrel flavors. As with its companion reds from Quilceda Creek, this is a wine to cellar for decades., 96.0, 110.0
US, Dr. Crane, A very rich, extracted and oaky style of Cabernet. You could almost call it a fruit bomb. Blasts in the mouth with an explosion of cherries, blackberries, plums, currants and carob. Lacks finesse. Could develop, but it's a risk., 86.0, 110.0
Italy, Riserva, Thanks to having some of the highest vineyards in Montalcino, Biondi Santi was able to make a stunning Riserva in the hot and forward 2007 vintage. It opens with aromas of forest floor and dried rose petals. The palate showcases concentrated wild cherry and cinnamon-spice flavors alongside bracing tannins. The wine already boasts impressive depth and structure as well as remarkable freshness for the vintage, but give it time to fully develop. Drink 2017–2037., 94.0, 800.0
Argentina, Oak Cask, Fairly oaky, as the name might indicate. Flavors of lemon, apple and pineapple are complete, if a bit common, while the feel is round and a touch resiny. Finishes solid, with a modicum of butter. On the heavier side, but acidic enough to maintain its balance. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd., 85.0, 10.0
US, Vecina, Very fine wine. Denser, richer, more powerful than the other Bond '01s. In the mouth, it has a molten quality, like liquid lead or mercury; strong flavors of plums, bitter chocolate, cassis, and good, rich oak. Pretty astringent now in tannins, it's firm and hard, but complex and layered. Drink now, but best beyond 2010., 96.0, 210.0
France, , A marvelously intense wine, the Chardonnay singing with light toast and acidity. The wine has layers of green apple, spice, a tight texture and orange zest highlights. Age for at least seven years., 97.0, 410.0
Italy, Riserva, Biondi-Santi performs exceptionally well in elegant vintages like 2006. This wine is balanced and fresh, with lingering notes of wild berry, white cherry, cola, spice and dark chocolate. Age this wine 10 years or more., 94.0, 900.0
US, Beckstoffer Dr. Crane Vineyard, Beautiful from start to finish, but tannic, and not drinkable now, in the classic sense. The tannins are hard, and while they're very finely ground, they prevent the palate from full appreciation of the lush blackberries, black cherries, dark chocolate and herbs. Give this 100% Cabernet at least five years to begin to mellow., 95.0, 110.0
Italy, , This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (65%), Merlot and Sangiovese is tad jammy and cooked. The wine delivers tight, tart tannins with impressive structure and length., 85.0, 110.0
US, Melbury, Has stunning fruit, for starters. Sheer, pure, concentrated nose of cassis and cherry. Subtle oak in the background, lending vanilla, toast and caramel nuances. Fabulous texture and weight, fine as velvet. Magnificently lush, full-bodied. Fantastic finish. Drink now through 2015., 95.0, 210.0
Argentina, Terruño Vistalba, A blasting bouquet of oak and affiliated cinnamon and spice are wave one, while next up there's dark fruit and a wealth of vanilla. This is one saturated Malbec, with menthol and tannins in spades. Only medium follow-through on the finish tempers the final grade. Imported by Southern Wine Group., 89.0, 20.0
France, , This is a powerful wine, driven by fruit and dark, firm tannins. It has a solid, chunky character, although that is balanced by the black plum and berry fruits and serious acidity. Both for its weight and its structure, it should age for several more years., 92.0, 600.0
US, , For the price this is a nice party wine. It's sweet, offering ripe citrus and vanilla flavors. Production was 5,400 cases., 84.0, 10.0
Italy, Vigna La Casa, Menthol, toast and modest berry offset a stern and firmly tannic wine that needs more time in the cellar. Wood notes tend to obscure the fruit and the finish is dry and somewhat astringent. Imported by Vineyard Brands., 89.0, 120.0
France, , This is a bright star in Olivier Leflaive's firmament, a wondrous big, rich wine that is just so finely poised. The structure is dense, rich, fat and full-bodied, a hymn to ripe fruit. Flavors are fruit-driven at this stage, but this is a wine that will develop over many years, if you can resist the urge to indulge its luxuriant tastes now., 95.0, 310.0
Germany, Bernkasteler alte Badstube am Doctorberg Trockenbeerenauslese, Honeyed and viscous—this practically pours like syrup—this is a rich dessert wine, filled with flavors of dried apricots and ultraripe peaches. It's long and sugary on the finish, just lacks a bit of acid balance, and while the hints of caramelized nuts may add complexity, they could also be a hint of oxidation. Drink now, in small doses., 90.0, 200.0
Portugal, Referência Grand Reserva, Made from a field blend of old vines to which some Tinta Roriz added, this powerful, ripe and fruity wine is both concentrated and superbly generous. It has swathes of black fruits, dark tannins and minerality, all striated with acidity and a firm black plum skin texture. This is a wine to age, drink from 2019., 94.0, 110.0
France, Brut, Light acidity and a crisp green-fruited texture offer fine freshness in this bright wine. The acidity is a delicious streak in the not quite dry final flavor., 88.0, 20.0
Spain, Pago Negralada, With its creamy oak and baked, stretched-out flavors, is it worth $110? You can decide, but the nose has that mildly cooked, heavy character that is reflective of 2003, and the palate is bland and drying as it mixes in oaky coconut and vanilla flavors. At one moment it's sharp and tangy; then it seems better. A confounding Tempranillo that doesn't excite., 84.0, 110.0
Italy, Messorio, Here's a “wow” wine you won't easily forget. Messorio is all Merlot, and happily delivers the softness, richness and overall opulence that we love in this noble grape variety. What elevates this particular expression and vintage is the true elegance and sophistication evident here. This is a huge wine, but it's not exaggerated and the finish is as long and smooth as they come., 99.0, 320.0
US, Heart Stoneridge Vineyard, This initially tastes like young fruit, herbal, with a lot of stem and flower flavors, but with some heat at 16% alcohol. Nonetheless it's delicious, compact, enormously fruity, focused and flat out amazing. A perfect mix of flesh, fruit, earth, and typicity from this unique vineyard., 98.0, 120.0
Italy, Brunate Le Coste, Indian spice and clove notes along with touches of ripe fruit and crushed granite appear on the bouquet. The finish is compact and polished., 88.0, 120.0
France, Sélection de Grains Nobles, Full-bodied, lush and sweet, yet despite the presence of ample botrytis, the wine retains a sense of varietal character in its lychee-scented aromas. Dried apricot and pineapple flavors linger for a long time on the mouthwatering finish. Delicious now, and should age well for at least 10 years. The 2001 and 2002 vintages are also currently available, and not far behind in quality., 94.0, 210.0
Australia, RunRig, Despite being loaded with complexity—spicy, meaty, savory and vanilla notes all feature in this wine—there's also explosive fruit. Swirls of blueberry and blackberry flavors are head-spinning and the texture is compellingly rich and velvety. If that isn't enough, the finish lasts for minutes. A blend of Shiraz from eight vineyards, all at least 90 years old, plus a tiny proportion (3%) of Viognier. Drink now–2024., 98.0, 220.0
US, Handley Estate Vineyard, With pineapple crème brûlée, Key lime pie and kiwi flavors that are accented with sweet, smoky oak, this Chardonnay offers an uptown sip compromised only by a certain herbaceousness. Drink now., 87.0, 20.0
Italy, Messorio, Messorio (a 100% expression of delicious Merlot) is a wine that has already reached elite cult status and for very good reason. The opulence, richness and overall pleasure factor are unbeatable and the wine is sophisticated, elegant and balanced at the same time. The long fade is characterized by vanilla, chocolate, espresso, cherry and blackberry., 98.0, 320.0
Portugal, Vale das Donas, Flavors of beetroot and juicy fruit are juxtaposed in this structured yet fruity wine. It has some bitterness and a hint of wood, and there is intense acidity on the finish., 83.0, 10.0
France, Cuvée Héritiers Latour, Aged in 100% new wood, this massive wine is full of dark plum and fragrant strawberries. It is also packed with dark tannins that give the wine a dry core. The fruitiness has a strongly juicy character, fragrant with acidity and freshness. The end is a reminder that this is a powerful wine. Drink from 2020., 94.0, 310.0
US, Obsidian, This is a devastatingly good Bordeaux blend from Howell Mountain. Based on Cabernet, it has all the flavor you could ask for in blackberries, cherries, cassis, chocolate, herbs, spices and sweetly smoked oak. But the structure is awesome. Near perfect tannins, soft and intricately firm, and grand acidity make for a total Cabernet experience. Tremendous now, and should age for years., 97.0, 120.0
Italy, Sassicaia, Recently implemented winemaker and cellar changes make this one of the best Sassicaias ever. This Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend delivers thick concentration and sun-kissed aromas of black fruit, prune, dried bay leaf, black olive and tobacco. The thick, fertile soils that characterize the magical strip of coastal Tuscany at Bol-gheri help shape amazing richness and intensity., 97.0, 220.0
France, Le Pigeonnier, This is the show stopper of the range from Alain Dominique Perrin's Lagrezette. It expresses the most powerful Malbec tannins and superripe fruit, without losing sight of the mineral edge. The fruit of this beautiful wine, while opulent, is poised with fine acidity., 93.0, 110.0
US, , Superb fruit highlights this tight, sculpted Syrah. It's extremely dense, with deep and intense raspberry and cassis fruit flavor, augmented with coffee grounds, smoke and iron filings. Complex, detailed, balanced and deep—what more can a wine give you? This is drinking very young and surely needs to be decanted. But already displaying amazing power., 96.0, 20.0
Slovenia, , This Riesling from Slovenia is a bit perfumed on the nose with an abundance of white blossoms, baby powder and pink grapefruit aromas, but there's a pleasant, citrusy sweetness and acidity throughout. Medium bodied, it finishes quite dry with a gentle white tea astringency., 86.0, 20.0
France, Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru, What to mention first? A hint of mossy earth, chamomile tisane, Cox Orange Pippin apples or lemon zest? All of these aromas dance on the nose. They are still totally shy on the taut, dry and concentrated palate. For now, it is mossy citrus that is most aromatic while rich fruit still needs to unfurl. This strikes a note of utter purity, of something soaring and bright. Right now this is totally brisk, invigorating and refreshing but its true colors won't show for some time. Drink 2020–2035., 96.0, 120.0
Italy, Biancosesto, A 50-50 blend of native grapes Friulano and Ribolla Gialla that is fermented in large casks, this full-bodied wine opens with aromas of white flower and acacia. The linear palate delivers mature pear and yellow apple accented with bitter almond., 89.0, 30.0
France, , A solidly structured wine, filled with fig, bitter coffee, spice and wood over a firm structure of tannins. The freshness is quite intense, but the ripe fruit is vivid with layered acidity and new wood. This is a serious wine, for aging., 93.0, 210.0
Turkey, , Deep red violet to the eye, this wine offers aromas of ripe cherry, pomegranate and orange zest. There is a sensation of coolness dominating fruit, with flavors of blackberry, pomegranate, menthol, clove and orange zest. It is a bit chewy on the palate; the strong tannins are crying out to be served alongside grilled lamb or beef., 86.0, 120.0
Spain, Partida Bellvisos, Compared to the excellent 2006, this wine is heavier, riper and jammier at every check point. The nose is baked and raisiny, while the palate feels saturated to the extreme and gritty as well. The primary flavors run toward baked plum and blackberry, while licorice, leather and raisin notes carry the finish. Give this lots of air after opening, about an hour or so., 89.0, 130.0
France, Fleur de Champagne Brut Rosé, Are delicate and full-bodied contradictions? Not here, with this ripe, red-fruit-flavored wine, which still creeps delicately around the palate. From its just pink color to its soft, yet still crisp aftertaste, this is a well-balanced wine, which could probably age well for 2–3 years., 90.0, 300.0
US, Bacchus Vineyard, Spectacular is the word that comes to mind here. Tasted over many hours, this stunning effort proved itself over and over. A mix of citrus oils, tree fruits, a hint of honey, tea, lemon verbena and more, it delivers astonishing complexity and flavor for such a young wine. It should continue to evolve and improve from 2024–2034., 95.0, 20.0
Italy, Cartizze Dry, Here's a Prosecco from the Cartizze cru (offered by the excellent Bortolin estate) that boasts mineral notes and talc powder followed by plush, creamy peach and yellow fruit. The wine ends with a very feminine note of fresh flowers., 88.0, 30.0
Hungary, Dry, This clean, dry white begins with aromas of spicy lemon and orange, leading in to flavors of lemon, orange rind and pepper. Light and mild, it's a simple but versatile food wine. Think grilled seafood, elegant cheeses., 85.0, 20.0
Italy, Paleo, Made from 100% Cabernet Franc, Paleo opens with concentrated, sweet-smelling aromas of plum, cherry and cinnamon, which translate to the palate with added notes of spice, leather and tobacco. This is bold, opulent and delicious, and it's guaranteed to please. Hold for 10 years or more., 98.0, 130.0
Spain, , Cabernet Sauvignon and Monastrell made in a ripe, high-alcohol style results in monster aromas of shoe polish and black licorice. The palate is a wave of chocolate and candied black fruits that crashes into a heavy, ultraripe finish of prune and pepper. A lunker wine with a sweet smile and a big handshake., 88.0, 130.0
France, , With its perfumed aromas, this is a wine that has richness and sweetness, with soft velvet power. It has an intense wood element that needs to blend into the rest of the wine, but the sweet black currant and freshness provide a good balance. This is a seductive wine, with a fine solid character., 95.0, 120.0
Chile, Casas Patronales San Carlos Vineyard, A bit too much chemical and lacquer on the nose. The palate is hard and the flavors rather limited and peppery. And the finish is dry, mildly bitter and not very rewarding. Imported by Vinecrest Co., 82.0, 10.0
Spain, Gran Resalte, With Ribera wines there's an assumption of tannic presence, but this older vintage, while displaying a classy bouquet, is brutally tannic, with an acid-washed palate. Splashes of cranberry and plum flavors are cut by lemony acidity and drying sandpaper tannins., 85.0, 120.0
Portugal, Colheita Tawny, Bottled in 2015, this wine from a great Port vintage is dark in color and so concentrated. It is powered by intense acidity from the wood aging as much as any residual fruit. Spice, dried fruits and a perfect balance give this great wine elegance and surprising freshness. Drink now., 95.0, 220.0
France, Les Charmes Premier Cru, This is rich, complex and full of ripe fruit. A firm structure underlies the richness, lending concentration and density. The fruit is still reticent and will show more generously in another year. Age for five years., 92.0, 110.0
US, Ladi's Vineyard, Very polite and proper: not too much oak, not too much fruit. All the ingredients are here in proportion, from the cedary, caramelized oak to the black-cherry and plum fruit that carries hints of dark earth and coffee., 87.0, 30.0
France, , The richness of this wine envelops you from the start. It is all about opulence, but it's balanced with layers of ripe fruit and wood. At this stage in its long life, this wine from a fine white wine vintage is still dominated by fruit. The secondary flavors will start to show in 3–4 years time. A powerful wine that does not lose sight of a potential partnership with food., 95.0, 320.0
Italy, Paleo Rosso, This extraordinary wine put Cabernet Franc on the map in Bolgheri. The 2010 reveals an exquisite bouquet of black currants, crushed blue flower, leather and baking spices. The smooth palate delivers mouthwatering blackberries, black cherry, white pepper, thyme and licorice alongside an age-worthy structure boasting firm but elegant tannins and fresh acidity. It's already gorgeous with intriguing depth but it will age and develop beautifully. Drink 2015–2040., 97.0, 130.0
Romania, Dulce, This collectible botrytis Riesling grown on the banks of the Danube in Romania is very concentrated, with heady flavors of honey, caramel and apricot and a nutty overall character. The finish is crisp and there's some acidity to keep the wine light on the palate. An unusual dessert wine and perhaps not for every wine lover, but definitely worthy of tasting and discussion. Imported by Vidalco International, LLC., 85.0, 320.0
Italy, Pian delle Vigne Riserva Vignaferrovia, This wine opens with some volatility that shows up as dried apple skin, strawberry jam, apricot and dusty earth. It offers polished tannins and bright, buoyant feel. There are loads of ripe strawberry on the close., 87.0, 130.0
Italy, Costa Russi, Purchased by the Gaja family in 1967, the Costa Russi vineyard produces elegant expressions of Nebbiolo with beautifully saturated, sun-drenched flavors. Indeed, this vintage shows wild berry with beautiful background renderings of smoke and graphite. Five percent Barbera is added and the wine shows amazing harmony and sophistication with bright acidity and firm tannins. It will only become more beautiful in time., 95.0, 420.0
US, Single Vineyard, This densely flavored and full-bodied wine has a very deep, dark color and aromas that suggest oak barrels, nutmeg and cardamom. The palate shows tension between firm tannins and acidity, and carries ripe blackberries, with spicy accents. Drink now through 2020., 89.0, 40.0
Italy, Stropa, Sharp mineral and vitamin notes are not inviting when considered individually but they do form a good frame to chewy blueberry muffin, cherry-pie and earthy aromas. It's probably better to drink this wine sooner rather than later before the mineral tones become too prominent., 87.0, 230.0
France, Comtes de Champagne Brut Rosé, Very airy, light and floating, this is a typical fresh, elegant wine in the Taittinger style. It has delicious, open raspberry and citrusy flavors, with a great finishing pizzazz of freshness., 92.0, 210.0
US, Royal City Stoneridge Vineyard, Depth and texture dominate; it's all whole-cluster fruit, aged in new barriques. This fine follow-up to the 2006 features a little more delicacy, with a lovely floral component and some earth. The depth is astonishing in the weight and texture and the way the wine plays out across the palate. The finish never ends: a glorious mix of black cherry, earth, herb, spice, and rock., 99.0, 140.0
US, , This easy-drinking Cabernet has flavors of blackberry jam and toast, wrapped into firm tannins. It won't improve with age, so drink up with a juicy burger., 84.0, 20.0
France, , The vintage brings out the tension of this magisterial Chardonnay, and it layers nervy acidity with fresh apple and peach flavors and intense minerality. It is poised and ready to develop over many years., 97.0, 330.0
France, , This is the big one, one of the most treasured white wine vineyards in the world. And the wine is magnificent, balanced with restrained power and style. Yellow fruits are shot through with acidity that conveys a nervy texture and an intense, concentrated character. This needs many years; don't drink before 2020., 95.0, 520.0
Austria, Saz Ruster Ausbruch, Wenzel's top cuvée is frighteningly expensive, but there's no denying the quality. Intensely botrytized aromas of dried apricots billow from the glass, accented by hints of toast, vanilla and coconut from aging in new oak barrels. Round and mouthfilling, it is very sweet, but with just enough acid to provide a semblance of balance. Dried apricot flavors dominate, but there's also superripe apple and melon flavors, while hints of spice and citrus emerge on the long finish. A worthy successor to the 2001., 94.0, 120.0
France, , This beautiful wine is austere at this very young stage. But what pent-up power—the richness comes from glorious ripe fruit, tempered with a core of steel and wrapped with pure lemon, apricot and toast flavors. Age for 10 years at least., 97.0, 430.0
US, Lola, This is as good as the best from California—textural, creamy, a delicious mix of lemon custard, meringue, caramel, papaya and toasted coconut. At one quarter the price of comparable bottles, this young wine just seduces from the instant it hits the tongue., 96.0, 30.0
New Zealand, Map Maker, This is appropriately intensely aromatic and flavorful, but the aromas and flavors come across as a bit simple and unnuanced. Modest grassy hints settle easily over white grapefruit flavors, which finish on a slightly chalky note., 86.0, 30.0
Italy, Sorì Tildìn, This is an elegant Nebbiolo-based wine and arguably the most feminine of Gaja's newest releases. There's extreme balance and sophistication evident in the focused aromas of wild berry, white licorice, pressed violets and polished stone. The mouthfeel is tight, firm and those tannins need at least 10 more years to soften in your cellar. Beautiful., 99.0, 440.0
France, N.P.U. Brut, N.P.U. standing for Nec Plus Ultra (translation “nothing further beyond”), this is a ultra-dry Champagne. It needs time to mature, so Bruno Paillard is to be congratulated for only now releasing the 1995 vintage. It has richness and freshness, the white fruits still scintillating in the glass. With the acidity over the ripe fruits, this could certainly age over the next five years or more., 94.0, 220.0
France, , A hugely rich, powerful Chardonnay, layering ripe fruit with a core of tannic structure, acidity, wood and huge depth of flavor. The wine is concentrated, with layers of fruit and textured acidity. Of course, it needs aging—7 years at least., 96.0, 130.0
US, Nicholas Estate Reserve, A funky undertone, similar to the Nicholas Estate bottling, weaves through the wine, along with a mix of cranberry, raspberry and sour cherry fruit. Despite the 14% alcohol, this wine seems light, delicate, the flavors pleasing but pale, and the finish a gentle fade., 88.0, 40.0
US, Royal City, This beautifully reflects the vintage as well as the place. There is astonishing density, length and detail—as much as any Syrah in the country. The deep, compact and impossibly complex flavors mix notes of black fruit, cassis, licorice, coffee, baking spice, smoke and Bourbon barrel., 98.0, 140.0
Portugal, Quinta de Vargellas Vinha Velhas Vintage, A serious, impressive wine produced from a small parcel of old vines at Vargellas. With minerality, spice, dark black plums and a dense tannic structure, this is obviously ready for a long haul of aging. The tannins give an initial bitterness, but then the juicy, wonderfully ripe fruit comes in., 96.0, 230.0
Italy, Giorgio Bartholomäus, Toasted oak, exotic spice and baked black fruit aromas slowly take shape on this structured Merlot. The densely extracted palate delivers coconut, blackberry extract, espresso, anisette and roasted coffee bean alongside rather astringent tannins., 88.0, 140.0
Spain, Pingus, Huge and on the border of overwhelming. But if you like yours concentrated and forward (although arguably not that complex) then Pingus is a dream come true. Start with the bouquet of coffee, earth, black truffle and smoked meat before digging into the wine's saturated black-fruit palate. Big tannins on the finish say lay it down for several years., 94.0, 320.0
Italy, Redigaffi, A cult wine and an international superstar, Redigaffi (100% Merlot) will blow you away with its richness, opulence and smoothness. Aromatic layers of milk chocolate, nutmeg, vanilla and Christmas spice peel back one thick layer after the next. This is a loudspeaker wine with extraordinary intensity and softness from start to finish., 96.0, 330.0
Spain, L'Ermita, Super pricey but this is a knock-your-socks-off wine with a gorgeous bouquet that shows not even a hint of syrup or jam. The palate is like a nova; it bursts with plum, blackberry and cinnamon. No harshness, not too tannic, and splendid on the finish, where toast and chocolate appear and stick around for a long time. It's 80% old-vines Garnacha and 20% Cabernet, and there just aren't enough superlatives to describe it. Only 300 cases made. Imported by Rare Wine Company., 98.0, 440.0
US, O.F.S., This is De Loach's finest Zinfandel of their five new releases. In fact, it's their best Zinfandel ever, and one that defines Sonoma County cool-climate Zinfandel. It's brilliant in balance and structure, with beautifully sculpted tannins and fine acidity, and just the right touch of oak. Within that package are savory flavors of wild blackberries, picked at their peak under the summer sun. So easy to drink, yet so complex., 95.0, 30.0
US, Cooke, Compared to Ravenswood's Monte Rossa, a shade less intense and concentrated, but more elegant. Dark and aromatic, with briary herb and tobacco flavors and, under the tannins, blackberries and coffee. Should develop further by 2006., 89.0, 50.0
US, , Lots of gooseberry flavors in this wine, alongside notes of lemons, grapefruits and limes. It's accented with fresh, citrusy acidity, and is entirely dry. If that tart, somewhat green taste appeals to you, it's quite elegant., 87.0, 40.0
US, Elevation 1147 Estate, There are incredible aromatics on this Cabernet. It's powerful yet subtle (how can that be?), all about sweet, crushed summer blackberries and pure cassis liqueur. Elaborate oak, in the form of buttered toast, is perfectly in balance, never overshadowing the fruit. The tannins are dry, rich and smooth, defining Napa elegance, grace and beauty. World class, dramatic and just about perfect, this gets better and better as it breathes in the glass. Drink now–2030., 99.0, 150.0
France, Le Viognier, Hard and unyielding for Viognier, with lemon and mineral elements that seem a bit out of character for the variety. Nevertheless, it's a crisp refreshing white for the summer., 85.0, 30.0
US, , Feels fancy and important in the mouth, with pure, refined tannins housing ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, chocolate, exotic spices and sweet, smoky oak. The finish is dry but with a tinge of sweetness, like an infused blackberry liqueur, which probably is the result of high (15.3%) alcohol. Very rich and layered, and a great addition to the Napa cult pantheon. Cabernet, with Cab Franc and Petit Verdot., 97.0, 140.0
US, Vice, Made from Beckstoffer's portion of To Kalon, this is exceptionally rich and decadent. Cabs don't get much riper. Blasts off with black currants, cassis, chocolate fudge and exotic spices. But the wine is soft and the alcohol is quite high, making it almost sweet. Would benefit from being drier and more structured., 89.0, 150.0
Italy, Masseto, Even better than the highly acclaimed 2001 vintage, this Merlot from a tiny, clay soil vineyard in Bolgheri is just about everything you've ever dreamed of tasting. Gorgeous, generous, voluptuous, cheerful, succulent and intense: Masseto is all those things. The aromas are seamless and capture the essence of chocolate fudge, sweet cherry, blackberry, spice and vanilla. It boasts thick, dense extraction, excellent structure and amazing persistence., 99.0, 250.0
Italy, Riserva Sergio Zenato, Gorgeous, rich and penetrating, this wine excels in terms of the elegance of its aromas. Layers of black fruit, spice, mesquite, beef jerky, cola and soy sauce are perfectly integrated and the wine shows plump, ripe richness on the close. Promises to age 10 years or more., 95.0, 130.0
US, Fortis, This Bordeaux blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon, is heavy and fruity, with an appealing taste like a blackberry and dark chocolate pastry. It's dry, and the tannins are rich and very finely ground, but it's really too dense to enjoy now. So will it age? The jury is completely out. Try after 2010., 87.0, 140.0
US, , Pungent notes of cranberry and pruny oak mark this wine, with tannins that are a bit tough and slightly out of balance., 83.0, 20.0
France, , A very buttery wine, it is soft, smooth and creamy in texture. Contrasting citrus flavors add a crisp touch. The acidity winds through the ripe fruit to give a bright edge., 89.0, 250.0
Italy, , The 2010 Ornellaia celebrates the wine's 25th anniversary, and it could not have been a more spectacular vintage. It opens with aromas of crushed blue flowers, black berries, pipe tobacco and thyme that give way to an elegant, structured and polished palate. It delivers intense blackberry flavors layered with white pepper, Mediterranean herbs, mineral and mocha brightened by fresh acidity alongside smooth, velvety tannins. This will age and develop for decades. Drink 2016–2040., 97.0, 240.0
France, Château Corton Grancey, This is one of Louis Latour's flagship reds, a powerful wine, with its dense, solid fruits, big tannins and concentration. Those black plum juices are building up behind a firm layer of dryness. Wait until 2012 before even considering drinking., 93.0, 120.0
Italy, Bricco Rocche Bricco Rocche, This excellent Barolo from Ceretto's Bricco Rocche estate represents a perfect marriage between grape and winemaking. The integrity of the fruit is there—plush, round, intense—and is supported by oak-driven notes of vanilla, cinnamon, cigar box and ground ginger. In the mouth, it tastes smooth and supple and offers long-lasting intensity. Drink after 2020., 95.0, 230.0
France, La Landonne, Dense and rich but also incredibly complex, long and elegant, this is a momumental Côte-Rôtie. It's darkly fruited and superripe, yet doesn't lose its essential sense of terroir, remaining marked by scents of pepper and espresso to go with the chocolate and cassis fruit. Velvety in texture, this is the one of Guigal's 2003 Côte-Rôties that demands a few years of cellaring. Drink 2010–2040., 99.0, 450.0
Portugal, 40-year old tawny, A very old wine which smells medicinal and tastes like sweet cough syrup. It's so concentrated as to be almost undrinkable., 83.0, 120.0
Argentina, , Past its sell-by date, with mealy aromas and dull flavors of apple and banana. The feel is flat, the acidity is not there, and the finish is bland and a little bitter., 81.0, 10.0
US, Red Wine, A stunning Pirouette—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 9% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis. A streak of iron and a hint of citrus keep the wine evolving through a long, beautifully balanced finish. Retasted after being open for 24 hours, the wine was as fresh and thrilling as on the first day., 98.0, 50.0
France, Les Folatières Premier Cru, Rich and rounded, with the toast sinking into the the rich yellow fruit and spice. The wine is gorgeous, opulent, while retaining an intense acidity and an edge of minerality. For medium-term aging., 93.0, 220.0
France, Blanc de Blancs Brut, Soft as well as fresh, this is a rounded Chardonnay, with white peach flavors to go with crisp acidity and a balanced lemon aftertaste. Light and a great apéritif., 88.0, 50.0
US, Occidental Vineyard, A terrific Pinot, and one of the few that absolutely demands cellaring. The tannic structure is enormous, providing a sandpapery dryness to the palate. Yet the flavor explosion is so powerful, you can enjoy it now with utter satisfaction. Erupts in grilled blackberry and cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon, anise, sautéed wild mushroom and smoky sandalwood flavors, leading to a spicy finish that continues for a full minute. Glorious and decadent. The winemaker was Sashi Moorman, from Stolpman, and the vineyard was planted in 1994 to the Calera clone. Only 115 cases were produced. Drink now–2017., 98.0, 150.0
Spain, La Viña de Corteo, Gritty, leathery aromas of campfire smoke and shoe polish set the stage for a lush, soft-bodied, extremely ripe palate housing modest tannins and tons of weight. Short, ultraripe flavors of blackberry and black currant come with a chocolaty note that's backed by a peppery, toasty finish. This is the definition of an opulent, heady, high-alcohol Syrah. Drink now., 91.0, 110.0
Spain, PV, What a monster this is. Aromas of roasted meat, compost, leather, berry and plum give it a rugged bouquet, while the superripe palate is big as sin and loaded with ultrasweet blackberry, soy and peppery flavors. Succulent, chocolaty and dark, it's like an earthquake in your mouth. Expensive for what you get, and recommended solely for fans of huge, modern wines. Imported by Kobrand., 88.0, 150.0
US, Estate, This is possibly the most savory rendition of Syrah made on the Central Coast, each vintage as feral as the last. This bottling shows bloody lamb, crushed peppercorn, soy and barnyard elements on the nose. The palate is tense with tarry structure, revealing unusual kelp, stewed peppercorn, black miso and teriyaki flavors., 96.0, 40.0
France, Lou Prince, A big black wine that is powered by its tannins and dark fruits and raisins. The texture is open and soft, probably a product of the hot 2003 vintage. A lighter bottle would be an advantage., 86.0, 40.0
Italy, , Dal Forno delivers one of the world's most impossibly rich and concentrated red wines. Using grapes sourced from the high-density Monte Lodoletta vineyard, this inky, dark expression oozes with syrupy tones of maraschino, dark chocolate fudge, cinnamon spice, crushed clove and barbecue smoke. In keeping with the wine's legendary reputation for long aging potential, the tannins are rock solid at the moment., 95.0, 530.0
US, Old Bones Stoneridge Vineyard, This displays extraordinary fruit flavors, along with a dense, deep minerality. The flavors seamlessly blend berry, rock, graphite, fresh herb, and light barrel notes. But the fruit! Ripe and rich and aggressively full bodied. Berries piled upon earth and rock, and the flavors linger forever., 96.0, 140.0
US, , The price is prerelease; it will soar on the aftermarket. This is very great Harlan. It pours dark and saturated, and the tannins are big and sturdy, not aggressive, but sweet and finely ground. Still, they give a hardness to the immaculately ripe fruit that mandates cellaring. The flavors of currants, blackberries, plums, chocolate and cedar are lush, deep and long-lasting, but just a part of the balanced appeal of this young wine. It really defines the exquisite tension between power and elegance. Best after 2008, then for many years., 98.0, 350.0
US, Beckstoffer To Kalon, This wine's overripeness shows up in the form of a bitter, dry, raisin taste, with heat from the alcohol. It has a solid core of blackberry fruit and beautiful tannins, but it won't age., 86.0, 140.0
France, La Turque, This is breathtaking stuff, incredibly complex on the nose, where it features hints of vanilla, clove, cinnamon, cassis, pepper and asphalt. It would be a wine to sit and smell all day if it weren't so delicious to taste. Rich waves of cassis fruit cascade over the palate without losing complexity, buffered by incredibly supple tannins. The virtually endless finish confirms the quality. Drink now–2030+., 98.0, 450.0
France, , This is full of fruit and weighty tannins. Coming from one of the finest vineyards in Burgundy, it is going to have great power and an opulent nature. This wine also has elegance, its black fruits controlled and with a mineral edge. That doesn't take away the power, it enhances the stylishness of this grand wine. Drink from 2020., 96.0, 240.0
New Zealand, , Fairly herbaceous, with aromas and flavors of green tea, herbs and tobacco that are complemented by cherry fruit. The soft tannins on the long, echoing finish bode well for the cellar., 89.0, 60.0
US, Special Reserve, Old-fashioned Barbera, and seems pricey for a wine this dry, tannic and acidic. The coffee and black currant flavors are very tart. Needs superrich meats and cheeses to soften it., 84.0, 30.0
US, Pluribus, In the Bond stable, Pluribus marches to a different beat. There's something of a baked pastry quality, with scents of marzipan, blackstrap molasses, and blackberry-cherry pie filling. This is the rawest Bond wine, the most tannic and least approachable. It's almost rustic in heft, like an Amador Zinfandel. Best to cellar for a few years, and could go the long haul., 91.0, 210.0
France, , This is a small, 10-acre property, owned by the Moueix family, at the heart of the Pomerol plateau. With its 30% Cabernet Franc it is perfumed and ripe, giving delicious black fruits as well as a firmer structure. The wine is set for a long aging with great potential. Drink from 2024., 94.0, 130.0
US, Allen Vineyard, This wine shows real first-growth quality in its intensity and concentration, with orange nectar, golden mango, pear, peach pie, buttercream, vanilla, buttered toast and spice flavors. The balance is exquisite, and the way the acids dance along the palate make the wine clean and lively., 97.0, 50.0
US, Prince Hill 777, Delicate and pretty, this has a pale cherry flavor, with light but proportionate tannins. It fades a bit quickly, offering a final hint of milk chocolate., 87.0, 50.0
Spain, Malleolus de Valderramiro, Gorgeous aromas of toasty oak, wood smoke, minerals and layered black fruits feed into a concentrated, thick palate that demands a knife and fork for dissection. Flavors of toast, vanilla bean, woodspice, bacon, mint and blackberry are lush. Give this beauty another couple of years, then drink through 2022., 97.0, 150.0
Spain, Altos Lanzaga Gran Viñedo, From a mediocre vintage, it seems as though the winery poured on the fully toasted oak to cover up marginal fruit. This smells like burnt meat and rubber, tastes charred and baked, and finishes blackened and overly toasty, with a choppy feel and hard tannins., 84.0, 130.0
Australia, Grange, This has all the size and weight you've come to expect from Australia's most famous wine. Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest. That said, the texture isn't quite as tight or as fine as some other vintages—expect this to be early maturing by Grange standards, and best from 2020–2040., 98.0, 850.0
US, Hillside Select, Another great Hillside Select from selected blocks in Shafer's vineyard. It's a perfect illustration of the “iron fist in a velvet glove” description of Stags Leap Cabernet, with perhaps more emphasis this year on the velvet than the iron. With smooth tannins and luxurious, oak-influenced blackberry and black cherry jam flavors, it's delicious now and will provide plenty of pleasure over the next 8–10 years., 94.0, 230.0
US, Fortis, This is a blend of the winery's vineyard sources in Rutherford and Stags Leap. It's very delicious and complex in blackberry and blueberry jam, cola, mocha and smoky oak flavors, but is surprisingly soft. It's almost as if the tannins and acids were taken out. Drink up., 87.0, 150.0
US, , Another fabulous Cardinale, better than the 2007 but short of the perfect 2006. This is so complete; it tastes like Cabernet on a cloud, light but ethereal, with ripe, polished blackberry and cherry flavors and touches of mocha, spice and cedar. The tannins are a wonder—soft and pliant—yet gorgeously complex. Drink now-2016, at least., 97.0, 250.0
France, Le Mesnil Blanc de Blancs, The latest release from Salon, this just explodes in the mouth with mineral, steel and flint. The tiny mousse has flavors of yeast and just a touch of toast. It is rich, but so austere and structured. Like many Salon Champagnes, this will age for 20 years or more., 97.0, 350.0
US, , What a spectacular effort. Dense and precise, it explodes from the glass with pure varietal scents and crisp, layered flavors. The mix of red fruits seamlessly weaves into barrel flavors of coffee, toast, caramel and buttered nuts, then adds licorice and spice to the long, clean,  lifted finish. A tour de force., 95.0, 40.0
Italy, La Coeta, Here's a winery founded at the start of the 1900s that has morphed over the decades to enthusiastically embrace modern use of oak. In fact, the wood here is almost too much of a good thing with carpentry and cedar notes that mask much of the cherry fruit. In the mouth, it has a chewy texture, smoke favors and a spice-driven finish., 88.0, 60.0
France, , There is a sense of pure juicy black-currant fruit that shoots through this great wine. With tannins that are firm while not a jot too much, the wine is crisp, packed with fruit and set for many years of aging. It is beautiful, fruity and intensely structured. Drink from 2027., 97.0, 450.0
New Zealand, Late Harvest, This lush, dessert-style Riesling is impeccably balanced. It's sweet but not overly so, with hints of dried apricot and honeyed peach on the nose and bergamot and orange marmalade flavors lingering on the finish. Imported by Cordon Selections., 92.0, 20.0
France, , Using grapes sourced from the greatest white-wine vineyard in Burgundy, this is huge, dense, very rich and complex. The balance already shows in the wine's acidity, ripe yellow fruit and round texture. Wood aging brings notes of spice and toast. This will age for many years., 94.0, 430.0
Italy, Giorgio Bartholomäus, This Merlot opens with savory aromas of spice and cured meat, followed by notes of blackberry preserves and black currant. It shows some secondary aromas of leather and pipe tobacco, plus lingering tones of rum cake, licorice and tar. There's a fresh, almost menthol-like quality to the palate, which offers tight, polished tannins and long savory flavors., 95.0, 140.0
France, , A ripe, toasty wine, very buttery. It has rich, almost sweet yellow fruit balanced with a wonderful mineral texture. The wine, of course, is still very young, but shows its future as being rounded and opulent. The acidity that holds it all together shows in the finish., 97.0, 550.0
France, Diamant Blanc Brut, A soft, very open, lightweight wine, that has some richness along with its white fruits. It tastes sweet, from what appears to be a relatively high dosage., 85.0, 140.0
France, , A beautifully structured wine, with its tannins layered between the ripest black plums, damsons and black currants. It is opulent while remaining dense, concentrated and very serious. Certainly a wine for long-term aging., 98.0, 360.0
Italy, Conteisa, A tiny percentage of Barbera grapes accounts for why this famous wine is not labeled as a Barolo. The Nebbiolo is sourced from the Cerequio Cru and offers long aromas of dried fruit, licorice, tar, tobacco, bitter chocolate and cola. The finish is extremely fine and polished. Drink after 2025., 95.0, 240.0
France, Vaudésir Grand Cru, This is on the weighty side of Chablis, giving a wine that is more Burgundy proper in its richness. That said, there is a good citric element, but the ripeness is more important, underlined by toast., 89.0, 70.0
Italy, Don Generoso, As its name implies, Don Generous doles out opulence and aromatic intensity, lingering long on the nose and palate. This is a smoky, masculine expression, with notes of lead pencil, slate, prune, cassis and spice. It delivers the essences of volcanic soil with dry and firm tannins at the back., 92.0, 120.0
US, DuBrul Vineyard Reserve Red, DuBrul is perhaps the single most sought-after vineyard in the entire Yakima Valley, and at this price this Tamarack selection is an absolute steal. Pomegranate, blueberry, black cherry and cassis notes lead into a full-flavored wine that remains concise and perfectly defined. The blend is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc. This is concentrated, with earthy depths suggesting Dr. Pepper, espresso and dark chocolate., 96.0, 50.0
France, , Attractive open yellow fruits have produced a wine that is so soft. Its texture is light, with a citrus character that runs with the wood. The finish has a more mineral texture., 86.0, 50.0
Spain, Finca El Bosque, Dark as night, and dominated by meaty plum and beef jerky aromas. The palate is huge, with pure fruit, tannin and chocolate pooling at the finish. A new classic in every sense, with stellar balance and complexity. Less than 400 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc., 96.0, 150.0
US, Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard, Too ripe and too oaky, and both attributes reinforce each other. The blackberry and currant fruit approaches Port in raisiny ripeness, while the oak accentuates the tannic sweetness. Clumsy now, but sometimes these wines improve in the long run. Try holding until after 2013., 86.0, 150.0
US, Père de Famille, This Père de Famille is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest split between Merlot and Petit Verdot. Sweet, pure fruit—black currants and black cherry and blackberry—is packed tight, concentrated and polished, but needing hours to breathe open. Dense, dusty, complex, complicated, this wine is sophisticated beyond description., 97.0, 60.0
France, Brut, Although the aromas are toasty, the flavors are still so fresh, rich, complex. This is a wonderful expression of taut minerality, pure citrus zest and then a wood-toast character that gives the wine both richness and sophistication. Given the fresh, intense fruit, this will certainly age for many years., 96.0, 350.0
US, Klipsun Vineyard, It's quite tannic, as is to be expected from this founding Red Mountain vineyard, and yet the wine seems smoothed over, buffed out. The black cherry and cassis fruit does not penetrate. Drink up., 87.0, 60.0
Italy, Scrio, Bold and complex, this Syrah opens with intense, superrich notes of chocolate fudge, maraschino cherry, tobacco, sweet spice and rum cake. Smooth, elegant and persistent, this amazing expression boasts ripe fruit tannins. Drink after 2016., 97.0, 160.0
Italy, G & G, This Amarone has aromas of ripe fruit and evident oak. On the palate, it's a bit lumbering, with mature plum, toasted oak, espresso and chocolate notes. Drink now and over the next few years., 87.0, 160.0
France, La Mouline, How can a wine be this hugely concentrated, yet remain supremely elegant? Espresso, black olive and floral notes zoom from the glass, backed by layers of rich, creamy cherry fruit, making this a complex, complete wine. Tannins are amazingly supple, imparting a velvety feel to the long finish. Drink now–2025 and beyond., 96.0, 450.0
France, RD Brut Champagne, Disgorged in 2009, this is a toasty wine, rich and concentrated. The idea of long aging before disgorging the yeast cells is to build up the unique complexity of the wine. In this Bollinger has succeeded magnificently. An opulent wine, with aging potential for 10 years or more., 97.0, 260.0
US, Estate Vineyard, So enormously delicious, it will be hard to keep from drinking this gorgeous Cabernet right away, and that's just fine. It's composed of the most intensly concentrated flavors of blueberries and blackberries—dense, pure and slightly heady with a liqueur-like alcohol. The tannins are classic Diamond Mountain, firm and minerally, while oak plays the perfect role of the buttered toast and sweetly charred supporting character. Despite its immediate attraction, it's best cellared for 6–8 years, at the very least. Fans of old Cabernets will still be loving it in 2029., 98.0, 70.0
US, McGinley Vineyard, A bit green, with thin flavors of citrus and herbs. Although it's dry and crisp, this Roussanne lacks richness., 83.0, 30.0
France, Domaine de Saint Pierre, Sure, it starts out a bit toasty and cedary, but that wood will surely integrate with the potent plummy, meaty fruit given a few years' time. It's full bodied and a bit coarsely textured for the moment, but finishes long and will clearly benefit from cellaring. Drink 2018–2025., 93.0, 130.0
US, , Acidity hits the palate like a shard of glass, immediately followed by rich, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cassis and spices. The tannins are strong, too. All the parts simply have not come together. Will it age well? It's not a slam dunk., 88.0, 70.0
Australia, Hill of Grace Vineyard, This is a bold, full-flavored, authoritative example of Eden Valley Shiraz. Cool-climate notes of cracked pepper elegantly frame waves of blackberry fruit that are fresh and zingy, not cooked or confected. This is firmly structured and built for the cellar, yet the tannins are ripe, forming a silky web that supports the fruit on the prolonged finish. Drink 2012–2035., 96.0, 550.0
France, Cuvée des Enchanteleurs Brut, A glorious Champagne, now at the peak of its powers and maturity. It is rich, creamy, lightly toasty, cookies and yeast propelling the fruits and acidity forward into a wonderful texture. This wine confirms Henriot's place at the top tables of Champagne., 98.0, 170.0
Italy, Masseto, This wine shows growing intensity the longer it stays in the glass and a very silky, polished feel in the mouth. Aromas include red fruit, spice and rosemary: this is a beautiful, balanced wine that will have a long life in your cellar., 97.0, 460.0
Portugal, 40-year old tawny, This wine certainly doesn't taste its age. It has more to do with sweet almond cookies and unbalanced spirit than mature flavors. Imported by Langdon Shiverick., 83.0, 130.0
US, Winfield Vineyard, Vintage seems to have made all the difference in this 100% Cabernet. The 2005 was rich and fat, the 2006 less so. You'll find plenty of acidity framing the juicy blackberry and black currant flavors. It seems to be very finely layered, so your best bet is to cellar it for 6–8 years and see what happens., 89.0, 80.0
Australia, Old Bastard, From vines planted in 1893, this is an inky, concentrated Shiraz. The aromas hint at cracked pepper, vanilla and blueberries, while on the palate, this is superripe and full bodied. Although close to being fat and overdone, yet it's held back from the edge by its long, licorice-and-spice finish. Drink now–2020., 93.0, 230.0
US, Companion, Fruity, soft and candied, this high alcohol wine has blackberry and cherry pie filling flavors, with a rustic texture. Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and a few other varieties., 84.0, 40.0
France, , Big tannins and impressive fruits are the hallmarks of this impressive wine. It is also subtle, not showing all its flavors at once, hiding beneath tannins and structure. For this fruity vintage, it shows a strong sense of direct, solid structure, only allowing the strong black plum and berry flavors to come through slowly. It is for the long haul, so don't drink before 2022, even better later., 97.0, 660.0
Italy, , Woodland berry, tilled soil, cake spices and a whiff of game are some of the aromas you'll find on this fragrant, impressive wine. The full-bodied, elegant palate delivers juicy red cherry, black raspberry, clove, chopped herbs and a hint of cured meat alongside a backbone of firm, refined tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2018–2026., 94.0, 140.0
US, Alexis Red Table Wine, A Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah blend off the estate. The winemaker says the Syrah brings complexity and backbone, although I don't know that the Cabernet needs much help. But this is an extraordinary wine. It's richly sumptuous in chocolaty, black currant fruit, and soft as velvet, but without being cloying, due to the sweet tannins and bracing structure., 95.0, 50.0
Germany, Graacher Himmelreich Eiswein Vat 28, Dark in color for an eiswein, with intense, caramelized sugar, golden-raisin and dried-spice aromas. Tastes intensely sweet and sour, with sky-high acids and sugars that can't quite keep up. And it finishes with tart, quince-like notes. Imported by Palm Bay Imports., 84.0, 140.0
Italy, D'Alceo, The beauty of this wine is in its elegant, restrained character. There are no loose ends or sharp spikes here. Instead, the 85-15 Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot blend is extremely compact and streamlined with beautiful extraction and pretty notes of chocolate, spice, tobacco and bold cherry. Imported by Vias Imports., 94.0, 240.0
US, Cuvée Amelia Reserve, There's something more to be found in this than the typical pepper and red berry flavors for which the variety is known. There's depth and complexity to the deep spice and coffee interlaced on the palate, and the finish is lingering and smooth. A very nice Syrah with great food-pairing potential., 85.0, 50.0
US, Select Private Reserve, The first sniff and taste tell you this is an important wine, but also a very young, tannic one. It's the structure, and not just the ripe flavors, that's so impeccable, giving the wine its backbone and strength. But speaking of flavors, the wine is gigantic in black currants and blackberries. One hundred percent new French oak is completely in accord with the size. Drink now, with decanting, and through 2015 at least., 95.0, 150.0
US, Reserve, Complex aromas of cassis, dough, espresso, bacon, and cola create instant interest. It seduces with its rich dark fruit and earth flavors, and a concentrated, suave mouthfeel. Big flavors and tannins don't quit on the long, even finish. Profoundly enjoyable, seamless and shows impeccable balance. Keep for five to seven years; it will last a long time., 96.0, 60.0
US, , Although this Cab is nearly seven years old, it's still hard and tough in tannins, and the tart acidity suggests it will remain unbalanced for the rest of its life. If you can get past the sharpness, it has dry flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants., 85.0, 150.0
US, Backus Vineyard, Shows the Bacchus profile of ripe blackberry and cassis fruit, pure, strong tannins and exceptional balance. It's a dry, classically structured Cabernet of enormous complexity and interest. So delicious now, it's tempting to drink, but it's way too young. This is a wine to cellar, and it should blossom over the next 20 years., 95.0, 250.0
US, , A plummy and rich nose, but there's also some varnish to it, even some paint thinner. In the field of big, high-priced players, this one doesn't make the starting lineup. It's a tad too hollow, and while good enough, it seems short on dimension., 86.0, 60.0
France, De L'Orée, Chapoutier's top white in 2004 is this knockout cuvée parcellaire he calls De L'Orée. Aromas of truffles and honey burst from the glass, while the flavors lean toward peaches and toasted nuts. It's full-bodied and undoubtedly high in alcohol, but there's no trace of heat, and while it's broad and mouthfilling because of its size, it still finishes fresh and minerally., 96.0, 160.0
US, Stagecoach Vineyard, This is really a spectacular wine. It's hard to say why it's so superior to Krutz's 2005 bottling, but it's richer and more elegant in every respect. Combines immense power with great finesse. The refined essence of blackberries, black currants and spices thrills the palate, accented with the most beautiful coating of smoky oak. A great achievement that should develop in the bottle through 2018., 97.0, 70.0
France, Diamant Rosé Brut, A mature, toasty wine, perhaps too toasty. There are still hints of ripe strawberries as well as the more mature flavors. The wine shows a full-bodied character and an attractive onion skin color., 86.0, 160.0
US, Jenkins Vineyard, Rich and silky, but a little heavy and soft. The polished cherry, raspberry, red currant, cola and bacon flavors are delicious, even complex, with an array of spices, and there's a lovely mouthfeel of silk and satin. But there's a certain direct quality. Drink now., 87.0, 70.0
Germany, Wehlener Sonnenuhr Vat 59 Trockenbeerenauslese, So unctuous and decadently sweet that this is one of those TBAs that's best taken in very small sips. Dried apricot, candied pear and caramelized pineapple flavors are concentrated and intense, lingering sweetly on the long finish., 94.0, 440.0
Italy, Sorì San Lorenzo, Perhaps less nuanced than the Sorì Tildìn, but more powerful, with round, mouthfilling flavors and firm tannins. Hints of tobacco and vanilla add complexity to rich plum and black cherry notes, finshing with a lovely touch of anise. Drink 2015–2030 and beyond., 95.0, 350.0
France, Les Pucelles Premier Cru, A powerful wine, showing rich, opulent Chardonnay. The spice and acidity crispen the wine, but leave the powerful fruit in all its glory., 96.0, 260.0
France, , A very concentrated wine with such a stylish feel. It balances ripe berry fruits with chocolate and wood flavors in the richest, ripest combination. The wine has power, without losing its poised character. It's ready for long aging., 97.0, 170.0
Italy, Riserva, Aromas of scorched earth, chopped mint, menthol, dried herb and mature berry lead the nose. The robust palate offers raisin, licorice, clove and espresso alongside evident alcohol. Aggressive tannins leave an astringent, tongue-drying close., 88.0, 80.0
US, Red Label, A controversial wine, tasted twice. It's soft and tannic, with candied cherry-berry, mocha and sweet oak flavors. Seems at once dull and powerful. Hard to know where it's going, but the benefit of the doubt suggests 4–5 years in the cellar., 87.0, 170.0
France, , This may be from the exceptional vintage of 2003, but Château Margaux remains true to form. First and foremost, it is a refined, elegant wine, with complex layers of flavors. But, yes, the hot summer is there the dense, dry tannins, but somehow they seem to float through the wine rather than sitting heavily in the middle. Acidity and freshness come to finish, giving the wine a delicious lift. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates., 96.0, 360.0
France, , The wood element is important here, but it is based on a firm Cabernet Sauvignon structure, dry but rich tannins. The wine is a great success for the vintage, giving sweetness, ripe fruit that only shows light extraction, and dark plum and berry flavors. The feeling is of polished fruit and wood, rounded but always dense., 95.0, 450.0
Italy, Riserva, Toast, oak, coffee, underbrush and baked plum aromas unfold on this extremely ripe, full-bodied wine. The densely concentrated palate delivers blackberry jam, licorice, oak roasted coffee bean, coconut and a vanilla note alongside astringent tannins. Give the tannins another few years to soften then drink sooner rather than later., 89.0, 90.0
US, IX Estate, This is an absolutely beautiful wine to drink now, but the richness comes at the price of considerable alcohol. The color is dark and impenetrable, the aromas huge in Cabernet-inspired blackberries and black currants, with a touch of something herbal and also a stony minerality. There's also a fascinating peatiness, like an Islay Scotch. It really opens up in the glass, becoming ever more complex. It's great Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, but that high alcohol may limit its ageability., 99.0, 290.0
France, , A solidly structured wine, it is both elegant and intensely powerful. It is disclosing its fruitiness slowly, at the moment dense and concentrated. A restrained edge provides complexity and balance. It will need aging, so don't drink before 2022., 95.0, 550.0
France, , A beautiful wine, with the firmest tannins surrounded by perfumed fruit. It is dense, of course, but this density is balanced with great elegance, blackberry fruits, sweetness and final juicy acidity. The wine is structured, a powerhouse of concentration while preserving this complete style., 98.0, 380.0
France, La Cabotte, From a parcel within the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, this is beautifully balanced, but a wine with considerable potential. It is rich, but thrust through with a sword of steel, giving acidity that offers a succulent counterpoint to the yellow fruits. The wood is becoming well integrated, offering further richness. For long-term aging., 96.0, 660.0
France, , While there is certainly plenty of wood here, the wine has weight and impressive concentration for the year. The tannins are still brooding away, giving a dark firm character to the wine. Blackberry fruits and acidity are there, but still well buried in the tannins., 95.0, 850.0
US, The Matriarch, This year's Matriarch is very similar to Harlan Estate in structure, and in some ways, a superior wine, or at least more delicious now. Shows the most beautiful black currant, cedar, blueberry pie and Asian spice flavors. What makes the structure so gorgeous are the firm tannins. Ultimately, it's a refined, exquisite red wine. Hard to imagine a better one for drinking over the next decade, and just shows that price sometimes has no relationship to quality., 98.0, 90.0
Italy, Tenuta Nuova, A “Wow!” wine on every level. This is a lovely, dark, smooth and rich expression that is packed tight with intensity and personality. The biggest, boldest wine by far from Montalcino's 2006 vintage, this bottle will age nicely and add value to your cellar collection., 97.0, 80.0
Italy, Costa Grimaldi, Costa Grimaldi is a spectacular wine that surprises with every sip thanks to its intensity and the extraordinary quality of its mouthfeel. Initially, the wine is soft and yielding with tones of red cherry, chocolate, cola, licorice and mineral. It grows even more opulent and velvety in the mouth thanks to its fine texture and tannins. Keep this wine in your cellar ten years plus., 96.0, 70.0
US, V Block, This incredibly tasty wine seems to melt in the mouth. Classic aromas of cinnamon, black cherry and cedar becomes more chocolaty on the palate as layers of cocoa, dark plum and toasted baguette unfold. Its texture is so velvety that the fine-grained tannins seem to dissolve as you sip, while still providing a slight grip that counteracts the richness and full body. Tempting now, it will be best 2022–2032., 95.0, 60.0
US, Brut X, Brut X is an extreme brut, made in a bone-dry style from a blend of 31% Chardonnay and 69% Pinot Noir with no added sugar. It's then aged four years. Floral in honeysuckle, the flavors are sharply focused and salty, a mix of lemon, pear and peach that can be enjoyed before, during and after a meal., 94.0, 50.0
Italy, Opere di San Pietro, Sweet tobacco and overripe cherry open the nose of this thick, jammy Amarone. The wine exhibits a syrupy, bold mouthfeel with lingering tones of smoke, beef jerky and spice on the finish., 88.0, 90.0
Italy, L'Apparita, One of the greatest Italian Merlots, the pedigree of L'Apparita is evident the minute you raise the glass to your nose. Notes of cherry and blackberry are seamlessly integrated with touches of oak spice, leather, tobacco and dark chocolate. The finish is long and smooth, and there's enough freshness and structure to allow this bottle to age for 10 years or more., 97.0, 180.0
US, OFS, A very fine Pinot Noir, dry and elegantly constructed, but it needs a little time in the cellar. That's due to the tannins, which are thick and noticeable in the way they create an astringency through the finish. The flavors are exceptionally rich, suggesting cherries, raspberries and tobacco, with a welcome sweetness from toasty oak., 93.0, 40.0
Italy, Solaia, The 2004 Solaia is dense and concentrated with loads of character and defining aromatics: plump blackberry, chocolate fudge, exotic spice, peppercorn and smooth balsam notes. The real pleasure comes in the mouth where it delivers smooth elegance and an extra long finish., 96.0, 170.0
US, Rosemary's Vineyard Estate Bottled, Tough and lean. This was a difficult vintage for Talley, who did their best, but the wine is lacking in fruit, although it's properly dry. Oak is the strongest flavor, dominating the modest cherries and cola., 86.0, 70.0
Germany, Rosalack No. 398 Auslese, A standout amidst a stellar lineup of 2013 Rheingau auslese, this deeply concentrated, complex Riesling is a kaleidescope of sensory offerings. Pretty white floral notes perfume swathes of marmalade and crushed minerals. It's unctuous yet spine tingling, lithe yet endlessly penetrating on the finish., 95.0, 160.0
Chile, VSC, Probably the best-eve wine from Santa Carolina. It's rich and earthy, but also shows pure fruit and just a mild hint of fresh herbs. Saturated and broad on the palate, with a nice mix of sultry fruit flavors and savory notes. Refined but robust; classy and elevated. 2,000 cases made., 92.0, 30.0
Italy, Essenzia di Caiarossa, A blend of Syrah and Alicante, this opens with aromas of underbrush, toasted wood, espresso and a whiff of exotic spice. On the palate, the fruit is almost completely dried up, leaving prune and oak-driven sensations of coffee and licorice alongside drying tannins., 87.0, 180.0
Italy, Schidione, For lovers of sophisticated Italian wine, Schidione (a hearty blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Merlot) shows personality, elegance and impressive intensity. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich. An excellent addition to a cellar collection., 94.0, 150.0
US, Naylor Dry Hole Vineyard, Lack of balancing acidity marks this wine, making the superripe currant, mocha and anise flavors taste incomplete. The alcohol is nice and low, but it still tastes heavy., 84.0, 50.0
France, L'Ermite, For white Hermitage, this is tight and minerally, with more structure than Chapoutier's other microcuvées and possibly more aging potential. There's a bit of truffle on the nose, but it's not so exotic as the De L'Orée, nor so rich and fat as Le Méal. Finishes with tremendous length and minerality., 95.0, 260.0
Italy, Riserva, Sharply defined aromas of spice, chiseled mineral, dried tobacco and cassis open the bouquet of this dark, concentrated wine. There's a floral note of spicy potpourri and cinnamon stick, tight tannins and bright acidity., 93.0, 140.0
US, Wallula Vineyard Biodynamic, Full-bodied, it leans into stone fruits and light tropical. Tasted a few weeks before its official release, it remained a little sugary, with its relatively high alcohol (and lower acidity) adding to the impression of sweetness., 91.0, 20.0
Italy, Messorio, This is an expertly crafted Merlot that offers much in terms of intensity, charm and personality. You could drink it with a fork and knife because its concentration is dark, plush and extracted with care. Pristine aromas of flower petal, red fruit, molasses and spice are rounded off by an outstanding mouthfeel consisting of extraordinary length and polished tannins., 94.0, 250.0
France, , When a Bordeaux wine gets into a heavy bottle, it has something to prove. As here, when the wine has way too much wood and lacks fruit. It could balance out, but that is a long shot., 84.0, 150.0
US, Stelling Vineyard, This is the most expensive of N&N;'s current Cab lineup and also a remarkably good wine. It combines flamboyantly ripe fruit with a fine, rich structure and balance, although it's a little soft. The complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries and cherries are well-oaked, and the finish is long and spicy., 92.0, 130.0
US, , Porty, both in aroma and flavor, with candied, caramelized blackberries. The grapes really got cooked, even though the vintage was a cool one., 82.0, 30.0
US, , Made in the Lokoya style, which is darkly colored, full bodied, tannic and dense in mountain fruit. A spicy oak tone joins with massive blackberry, cassis and violet flavors to make this wine delicious from the start. It's very tannic and needs a great deal of time. Begin to enjoy this wine in 2016, and it should go far longer than that., 94.0, 350.0
Italy, Masseto, Fruit was picked later than normal and the Masseto Merlot does indeed show mature aromas of black cherry, ripe blackberry, earthy iron and polished stone. The intensity and purity are amazing and the wine is sophisticated, soft and very rich on the finish. It is already showing beautiful evolution in the glass., 95.0, 460.0
France, , A serious wine, filled with firm tannins, spiced with wood, and layered with bitter coffee as well as fruit. It certainly has power, the structure ready for long aging, firmly anchored in the dense character of this wine. It is a medium aging wine, 5–10 years., 94.0, 450.0
US, Collector's Reserve Puerta Dorada Vineyard, Tastes young and jammy now, with perky, tartly sweet flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants. Oak adds smoky complexities that bring to mind mocha, vanilla and buttered toast, with a sprinkle of cinnamon. Somewhat lacking in nuance, with plenty of flash, this Cab should develop over the next 6–8 years., 91.0, 120.0
Portugal, 40-year old tawny, Lovers of Italian bitters should pay attention to this wine. It's medicinal character is very intense, very herbal. Good for the stomach, maybe, but it's not Port., 82.0, 130.0
New Zealand, Trillo, Odd stuff, with honeyed sweet green-pea aromas and flavors suggestive of older New Zealand Sauvignon, turning lemony on the finish., 81.0, 20.0
Spain, El Perer, This single-vineyard Carignan is living proof of how impressive the variety can be, especially when hailing from a top year like 2012. Schisty aromas of blackberry, chocolate and mocha are smooth and alluring. This feels focused, pure and juicy, while dense blackberry, mocha and baking spice flavors tail off with exotic notes of Malabar pepper, toast and the finest black coffee. Drink through 2023., 96.0, 770.0
Portugal, Point West, It is called Point West because Estremadura's vineyards are the furthest west in Europe. The wine itself is soft and fruity initially, but then there is a tight tannic texture, followed by black currant fruits. The wine is finely made, elegant, just on the warm side of cool., 89.0, 11.0
Germany, Bombacher Sommerhalde R GG Reserve Erste Lage, Aromas of dried strawberry and cherry preserves brighten notes of toasted oak and dried herbs in this wine. The palate is crisp and youthful, with red cherry flavor, and a slightly bitter edge that adds depth and dimension. Soft, chalky tannins linger on the warming finish., 89.0, 111.0
US, Illustration, A spectacular wine that gets better and better with every sip. It's dramatic from the get-go, with rich, fine tannins framing extraordinarily good flavors of blackberries, black currants, anise, dark chocolate and cedar. Superb structure, great length and finish, with perfect acidity. A joy to drink. Now–2016., 97.0, 90.0
France, , A classic in development, a wine that will last for decades. It is certainly powerful, but already the shape is finalized, with its plums and berries settling down with perfumes, acidity, just enough tannins and a warm, welcoming richness. A great argument for the superiority of 2001 over 2000., 97.0, 190.0
US, St. Helena Home Vineyard, There's a softness to this dry wine. It's forward and rich in currants and smoky oak, but could use greater acidity. The tannins also seem a little ungainly, although they could mellow out in a few years., 87.0, 90.0
US, Ten, Only a Burgundian ideologue would find anything not to like about this mouth-filling Pinot that captures the essence of Santa Rita Hills. It's as voluptuous as any Pinot in California, offering waves of ripe, fleshy cherries, red currants, licorice and smoky vanilla that just don't stop in palate appeal. For all that, the wine is elegant, silky and refined. Delicious now, although a little tannic, and will benefit from decanting and aging. Bring on the steak., 96.0, 80.0
France, Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs, Intensely Chardonnay, this beautiful wine, named after the ancient rulers of Champagne, is pure mineral, green and citrus fruits, a steely shaft of pure concentration. Now just with a light touch of toast, this still will mature for several years., 96.0, 180.0
US, , Heavy and sweet, almost sugary in blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors, with a smoky, hot finish. A good wine that will appeal to those who like its candied taste., 86.0, 80.0
US, Fiddlestix Vineyard, A spectacular Pinot Noir, but you don't want to open it anytime soon. Shows the pedigree of this vineyard, a superbly balanced wine rich in acidity and minerals. The fruit? Black and red cherries, blackberries, cola, cocoa powder and red currants, enriched with smoky cedarwood. Beautiful, but needs time. The window is 2011–2013., 95.0, 70.0
France, , This firm, tannic wine is made from fruit sourced from a vineyard in the heart of Morey-Saint-Denis. It's a solid selection, and it has enormous potential. The ripe black-cherry and plum flavors are dominated by the tannins. Concentrated, this is ready for long-term aging., 96.0, 280.0
France, Legend Vintage, With only 795 bottles produced, this is a special treat. Although it's ready to drink now, it has the structure and pedigree to age for decades. Loaded with rich nut and rancio flavors, there's so much going on; aromas of dried orange peel, gingerbread, toasted macadamia nut and a drizzle of molasses lead into flavors of dried red plum and fig dusted with Nutella powder and soft white pepper. Complex, spicy and full, with an endless finish., 96.0, 380.0
Italy, Solaia, Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese (with a small touch of Cabernet Franc), Solaia's winning card is texture. The wine is soft, velvety and penetrating in the mouth with succulent flavors of blackberry, creamy cassis berry, chocolate and tobacco. Thick extraction and quality fruit craft a memorable wine that will last many long and happy years in your cellar., 95.0, 170.0
France, Les Quatre Journaux, Solid and tannic, it perhaps lacks huge weight but shows elegant structure and rounded tannins. The wine is already deliciously fruity, and will charm as it ages. Black fruits are right up front, the tannins a fine supporting act. Drink from 2017., 93.0, 740.0
US, , This feels sharp and raw, with ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, plus a streak of sweet, toasty oak. Drink now., 85.0, 70.0
France, Le Méal Ermitage, Although 2006 won't go down as a great vintage in the northern Rhône, Chapoutier's selections parcellaires are still top notch. Le Méal gets the nod this year as the most powerful of the group, with massive espresso and black olive elements tinged with meat and underlain by a bed of ripe blueberries. Long and mouthwatering on the finish, look for this wine to approach maturity by 2016; drink well through 2025 or longer., 95.0, 270.0
Italy, dei Togati, Dark-skinned berry, underbrush and star anise set the tone of this full-bodied red. The palate is juicy and polished, full of ripe black cherry, tobacco, clove and tangerine zest flavors, ribbed with fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019–2025., 90.0, 110.0
US, Doctrina Perpetua, There is nothing shy about this wine, but the ripeness and high alcohol are beautifully handled. It remains precise and focused, with deep black-cherry, cola and coffee flavors. The tannins are fine grained, and the acids are sufficient enough to give it a frame and the prospect of aging for up to a decade., 94.0, 60.0
France, , For the year, this is a big wine, a success. New wood flavors and tannins blend well with the weight of fruit, depth of flavor and concentration. The wine has freshness to give with the structure, solid and intense. Certainly for aging—five years and more., 94.0, 160.0
Portugal, , Warm and fruity, this has plum and loganberry flavors that are supported by some tannins. The wine has richness, spice from wood and red fruit acidity. With its tannins, it would be worth aging this for a year., 88.0, 11.0
France, , This wine is dominated by new wood, which goes right through the big, dark fruit flavors and tannins. Very ripe cassis flavors are under this wood, waiting likely for many years before the wood flavors subside. This is very much in the modern, polished style of Mouton today, made even more pronounced by the heat of  the 2003 vintage. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates., 94.0, 260.0
France, , A glorious outpouring of beautifully crafted Chardonnay, opulent but tightly mineral. The ripe apple and pear character has a delicate, elegant squeeze of lime, while the whole wine is underpinned by wood. No doubt for long-term aging., 98.0, 411.0
Germany, Herrenberg Eiswein 375 ml, Shows lovely balance between intense sweetness and crisp acidity, so that the wine's honeyed citrus notes really sing. Hints of marmalade, clove and a perfumed, slightly minty note all add complexity. Delicious now, and probably for a good many years to come., 93.0, 50.0
Italy, Dedicato a Walter, An impressive wine from an impressive vintage, this Tuscan expression of Cabernet Franc opens with opulent fruit notes of blackberry, prune, plum and ripe cherry backed by clove, pepper, leather and cigar box. The tannins are firm and silky and the fade is long and velvety., 96.0, 90.0
US, Select Private Reserve, This is a gigantic wine made solidly in the modern cult Napa style of dazzling power. It's similar to the winery's 2005, although lacking some of its structure. Massive in blackberries, black currants and cedar flavors, with a pleasantly earthy edge of green olives and carob. Extremely fine, but wants some time in the cellar. Better after 2012., 93.0, 150.0
US, , Hard and dry in tannins, this Merlot has cherry and red currant flavors. It's properly clean, but the astringency is really tough, and the wine seems unlikely to age through it., 83.0, 50.0
US, Robert's Blend, A good wine, but incomplete, and shows why Cabernet Franc is a tough variety to bottle on its own. You get a blast of cherries and oak, with sturdy tannins, but the wine lacks depth and complexity., 86.0, 90.0
France, Les Vieilles Vignes, This is a ripe wine, full of apple and apricot fruit with a strong citrus line. A touch of minerality adds tangy texture and gives this rich wine plenty of life and freshness. Drink from 2015., 89.0, 31.0
France, Les Baudes Premier Cru, From organic vineyards, this wine shows rich fruit and generous red berry flavors. There is ripe sweetness as well, with soft tannins from the fruit. At this stage, the toast element from the wood is too dominant, but this should soften over the next 3–4 years., 90.0, 210.0
US, Double Plus, A small-production, estate-grown wine, it conveys a richness of berry cobbler, supported by a tension of deep, dark chocolate. Tobacco and tea add to the complexity and leather-bound-chair feel of things, with structured, large-sized tannins adding strength before the finish lands softly., 93.0, 250.0
Spain, 6 Años Reserva Premium, Nicely oaked blackberry, licorice, vanilla and charred aromas are smooth and sultry. This is an outstanding wine from an excellent year.

Enjoy this top-notch Tempranillo through 2030., 95.0, 80.0
Italy, Rocca Sveva, Here's a perfect match to sausage and white beans. This bright and clean Ripasso offers easy notes of spice and mature fruit with a distinctive note of almond nut. It delivers a lean, but firm mouthfeel with a light alcoholic push at the end., 88.0, 21.0
France, , This dark, brooding wine is still tight and closed. It's powerful and concentrated, with gripping tannins as well as delicious black fruits. It's solid, chunky and very firm while retaining the generous fruitiness of the vintage. Don't drink before 2020., 95.0, 180.0
US, , Take a sip, and you think, Wow, that's good. Dark, deeply aromatic in blackcurrants, mocha java coffee, subtle herbs, green olives and fine oak. Turns sweet but dry in blackberry and cherry flavors wrapped in beautifully ripe, soft, expressive tannins., 92.0, 40.0
Spain, Clon de la Familia, This is the granddaddy in the Emilio Moro portfolio, but the wine is so ripe and oaky it's syrupy-smelling. Maximum ripeness means it's a bit Port-like on the palate, with baked black-fruit flavors that finish soft and jammy. This brims with power, extraction and flavor but it's grasping for structure. Drink through 2019., 93.0, 450.0
Austria, Nouvelle Vague Nummer 10 Trockenbeerenauslese, Marmalade, syrup, molasses and a deep layer of botrytis dryness are all elements of this superb wine. But it is so much more than the sum of its parts, because it is the sheer intensity that makes it so fabulous. The finish prolongs the pleasure, the acidity mingling with pure concentration and wonderful, unforgettable honey and fresh fruit., 97.0, 111.0
France, , For many, this vineyard offers the purest form of Pinot Noir, a seductive, opulent style, with rich fruits dominant, the powerful acidity deceptively sweet. Add to this a tight, firm, smoke-and-toast tannic structure, and this is not only a fine wine now, but one with long-term potential. Keep for at least six years., 95.0, 380.0
Spain, Monastrell - Syrah, Nice on the nose, with berry aromas, ample richness and rubber. The powerful palate delivers big-time blackberry, toast, roasted plum, coffee and chocolate, while the finish is also chocolaty and stout in structure. Chunky but tasty. A good Jumilla wine consisting of 85% Monastrell and 15% Syrah., 87.0, 11.0
Spain, La Mala, Earthy, dark and meaty wine, with rubber, deep black fruit, bacon and leather on the nose. This is a typical huge wine from Atauta, with roasted plum, blackberry and ingrained spice flavors. Long on the finish, with tobacco, herb and oak character. Drinkable now but it's hard and tannic; better to wait three to 12 years., 92.0, 140.0
US, Evenstad Reserve, This includes grapes from the winery's Jerusalem Hill vineyard in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA, in addition to the Dundee Hills sites, hence the more general Willamette Valley designation. It was aged in 65% new French oak for 16 months. It's open and generous, offering bright berry, cherry and red currant fruit matched to defining acids, all set in a fine-tuned frame of new oak. Re-tasted 24 hours after being opened, it remained fresh, dense and satisfying., 94.0, 70.0
France, Les Charmes Premier Cru, This pleasantly perfumed wine has some acidity, jammy red fruits and soft tannins. It feels very rounded and smooth, with a structure that is totally integrated into the velvet texture. Drink from 2016., 89.0, 141.0
France, Barrel Sample, 93-95. Barrel sample. A firm and tannic wine, it has the weight to support its tannins. It's balanced, solid and dense, with a powerful shot of black fruits., 94.0, 170.0
France, Domaine Grand Veneur La Fontaine, A rare slip up from the talented Jaume family, this 100% Roussanne is swimming in smoky, toasty oak, with the fruit currently hidden. You could gamble on it bouncing back in 5–6 years, or just wait for the better-balanced 2010., 84.0, 70.0
US, Artist Collection, Dark, robust, dry, full bodied, tannic and acidic. That pretty much sums up this old-fashioned, young wine. It's a serious cellar candidate, stuffed with blackberry jam, leather and coffee flavors. Best after 2010 and for years beyond., 88.0, 31.0
France, Les Baudes Premier Cru, Opulent yet so elegant, this wine has already achieved great balance. It comes from the soft richness of the generous fruit, the spice from both the wood and the fruit, and the roundness of the texture, which envelops you in its warmth and ripeness. And, at the end, just to give a great lift, along comes the acidity., 95.0, 90.0
Italy, Don Totò, Don Totò is an austere, oak and spice-driven wine with aged aromas of resin, licorice, candied fruit, cherry liqueur andalmond pastry. The 5-plus years of age help fuel bursting cola and balsam-like intensity in the mouth., 89.0, 51.0
Italy, Tosco Forte, Sangiovese with 10% Syrah presents a united front of berry, spice, toast and cola nuances. The wine has substance and good acidity that would pair seamlessly with pork roll, pasta with sausage and tomato sauce or cheese-filled ravioli., 87.0, 21.0
US, , A problematic wine. It's too tannic and closed to enjoy now, and the fruit flavor may not be powerful enough to withstand aging. Then there's the sweaty taste that provides a jarring note, and may be tamping down the fruit., 85.0, 90.0
France, Le Pigeonnier, Coming from a seven-acre vineyard named after the dovecote on the property, this is a magnificent wine. Powered by both fruit tannins and the 28 months of new wood aging, it is darkly rich and with great concentration. As a sign of its pedigree, there is also elegance here, a restraint which is new to this wine. That makes it a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2022., 95.0, 290.0
France, Château d'Ampuis, In this difficult vintage, Guigal's Château Ampuis bottling shines. The kinky nose features exotic notes of celery seed, cracked pepper, hickory smoke and mixed berries, while in the mouth the wine shows ample fullness and intensity without losing any of the silky character that makes Côte Rôtie special. Drink now–2020., 93.0, 160.0
France, Grand Siècle Alexandra Brut Rosé, A wonderful wine that has preserved its freshness while welcoming elements of toasty maturity.

US, Carabella Vineyard, Yummy, with ripe, plush berries running rampant across the tongue. The juicy acids and underlying minerality add lift and life, but the fruit, rolling from cranberry to boysenberry to blackberry, just won't let go. The structure suggests ageability for another decade of more., 91.0, 30.0
France, , Big, firm and dense, this is a powerful wine, with dark tannins that give a dry, concentrated character. The juicy plum and damson fruit flavors, along with the fresh aftertaste, will be a delicious balance as the wine develops. Drink from 2020., 93.0, 260.0
Spain, , Big on the nose, with regionally typical aromas of mineral, black fruit and herbs. The palate is a touch rough and hot, but it houses forward black plum, raisin and chocolate cake flavors. Fleshy and pretty big, but sort of wayward on the finish. Shows good structure and power. Imported by Grapes of Spain., 88.0, 41.0
France, , A smooth, velvet textured wine, piled high with sweet, ripe flavors. There is fine, opulent concentration here, impressive density, and a solid, tannic core. While it is not as powerful as some vintages from this estate, it certainly suggests the ability to age 5–6 years and more., 93.0, 360.0
Italy, Ca' del Sarto, Here's an easy-going and traditional expression of Barbera that is not overstated or exaggerated in any way. In fact, fruit intensity is measured and the wine presents an informal, no-fuss but elegant front. You'll get aromas of cherry, blackberry and spice., 86.0, 11.0
Portugal, Grande Rocim Reserva, The top wine in the Rocim range is produced from selected Alicante Bouschet grapes. It is huge and powerful, perhaps too much in its concentration, richness and density. Dark and brooding, it is super everything and certainly needs to calm down. Drink from 2019., 91.0, 130.0
Germany, Bombacher Sommerhalde R GG Trocken, Abundant layers of char and smoke threaten to overtake the bright black-cherry and green herb flavors on this premium wine. Aeration brings the fruit to the forefront, but hints of toasted wood and dill linger on the finish., 86.0, 111.0
France, , This is a very spicy wine with weight, great depth of flavor and concentration. Fine acidity cuts through the core, balancing sweetness and adding freshness to flavors of wild thyme-honey and orange marmalade. Drink the wine from 2017., 94.0, 80.0
France, Grande Cuvée Brut, With its minimum of six years' bottle aging, this is a beautifully integrated, mature wine. It has a wonderful toast character, layered over sliced pears and ripe acidity. With its complex poise between lightness and richness, this remains an intensely impressive wine., 94.0, 180.0
Italy, Brut Saten, Peach and smoke aromas open this dry bubbly, but these pretty notes are marred by a soapy element. It's fairly dry, with faintly peachy flavors, intense mineral and even slightly medicinal accents., 81.0, 30.0
Spain, , Earthy, ripe aromas of raisin, blackberry and graphite announce a warm-vintage wine. With grabby tannins, there's bite and abrasiveness to the mouthfeel. Flavors of earthy blackberry and plum finish raisiny, short and heavy., 87.0, 31.0
France, , Rich and ample, this is an impressive wine. The fruit and wood flavors work together to give a feeling of seriousness and great ageability. With its spice, toast notes and dark-hued structure, this will age well over the next five to 10 years., 94.0, 280.0
South Africa, Liber I, Cloves, black fruit and vanilla spice on the nose are followed by a brooding array of tobacco, spice, red berry and vanilla on the palate. Full-bodied but smooth, with a lingering, savory finish. Pair with steak, lamb or aged cheeses., 88.0, 51.0
Italy, Campogiovanni, Campogiovanni is a rich, inky expression of Sangiovese Grosso with beautiful personality and length.

France, , Intense green plum, topped with pineapple sweetness and acidity, give this wine fine density of flavor. The fruit dominates, the wood a hint in the background, just offering some extra spice. There is a lively, juicy green and white fruit freshness to the finish., 89.0, 71.0
US, , Here's a soft, luscious Cabernet. It has soft tannins and is very delicious, with a milk chocolate edge to the black and red sour-cherry candy fruit, enriched with rich, toasty oak. Lovely now and should develop over the next 6–8 years., 92.0, 150.0
Argentina, Amadores, The nose displays some tree bark and sawmill, but underneath there's savory spice alongside black fruit. The palate is ripe and deep, with berry essence and clove. Dark chocolate carries the finish, which is firmly tannic but not overly hard., 86.0, 21.0
US, Connoisseur Series, This doesn't show any particular Stags Leap character; it's another dry, tannic and lean Cabernet, with cherry syrup flavors. Drink now., 82.0, 50.0
US, Heritage Single Vineyard, This wine is quite opulent, and brimming with flavors of new oak, black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate. While the tannins are thick, they're soft enough to drink now., 92.0, 250.0
Italy, Le Stanze, You'll love the rich concentration and density of this wine. The nose is finely focused on aromas of black fruit, moist tobacco and black pepper. In the mouth, this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend delivers firm, drying tannins and a long burst of black fruit on the finish. Drink after 2012., 93.0, 70.0
Portugal, Colheita White, This was a great vintage Port year, and this white Port, which was bottled in 2015, has hints of the firm tannins and structure that marked out the year.

The wine is, of course, ready to drink., 94.0, 980.0
US, Maddie's Vineyard, This is the richest of the winery's Pinots, and it shows a blast of pie-filling cherries, black raspberries, pomegranates and red plums, along with savory spice and vanilla oak flavors. It's a bit soft, but supported by finely ground, velvety tannins. Best now and through 2010., 88.0, 61.0
US, Beau Melange, With sharp acidity, a hot mouthfeel and rich flavors of cassis liqueur and chocolate-covered raisins, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend tastes more like Port than a dry table wine. Lots of new French oak does not restore balance. Drink up., 82.0, 150.0
US, Cherryblock, The winery has been producing this bottling for many years, and this is possibly the finest ever. It's soft, but not too soft, ripe, but not too ripe, and exquisitely flavorful, offering tiers of red cherries, cocoa and bacon, enhanced with smoky, sweet new oak. It's a fine wine to drink with grilled steak., 94.0, 90.0
France, , Initially, this seems soft, big but gentle. Only slowly do the tannins come through, and even then they are only part of the supremely rich wine. It has concentration followed by chunky fruits, finished with almost jammy sweetness. Obviously appealing now, those tannins will see it age well., 93.0, 270.0
France, , A big, burly wine, powerful, concentrated and packed with fruit, the tannins a potential aging advantage underneath all this delicious fruit. Solid, but charming at the same time., 94.0, 190.0
France, Orgueil de France Brut, A very mature, toasty wine, which has acidity and wonderful toasty flavors. It is rich, but somehow there is a hint of sweetness from the dosage which suggests the wine is reaching the end of its life. Drink now., 84.0, 90.0
US, IX Estate, From the estate, in the Pritchard Hill area of St. Helena which is worthy of its own appellation, comes this densely structured, impressive but young wine. It's massive in fruity extract and new oak, flooding the mouth with soft, ultrarich flavors of blackberries and dark chocolate and a leathery, peppery, grilled meat quality. This is the kind of wine even a non-red wine drinker will be dazzled by, and connoisseurs will appreciate its power and finesse. Ready now for sheer opulence, and should develop through 2012, at least., 94.0, 290.0
Austria, Nouvelle Vague Grande Cuvée Nummer 7 Trockenbeerenauslese, Kracher's Grande Cuvée is often the epitome of a vintage.

The lush, sweet orange flavor istamed by acidity, which provides a fitting lift to the finish., 95.0, 111.0
France, Sauvignon, A soft, lightly herbaceous style, with good green apple and white currant flavors. Crisp, light, refreshing, drink this year., 85.0, 11.0

France, Aux Vignes Clos Rebberg, A very oxidative style, with unusual, though intense, flavors of straw and compost intermingled with poached pear and wet stones. The high quality of the raw material comes through on the long, caramel-apple finish. Drink now., 87.0, 51.0
France, , The balance of this wine is what makes it so impressive. Spice and yellow fruit intermingle effortlessly. There is a core of tight, coiled steel, like a spring, which gives minerality along with the richness. At the end, acidity lifts the wine, finishing with freshness as well as intensity., 97.0, 451.0
Portugal, Colheita Tawny, While this wine from a year that was not declared as a vintage, it has sweetness and ripe caramel and toffee character and it does, inevitably, show some age. So the acidity and intense wood flavors are dominant, giving a wine that is dry while still very drinkable. It is a Port that is so concentrated and dense—the distillation of a tawny. Drink this impressive wine now., 93.0, 770.0
US, Rochioli - Allen Vineyards, Stunning and dramatic, reminiscent of a fine Burgundy. Hugely complex flavors of grilled tropical fruits, minerals, peaches and pears, elaborated with waves of smoky, honey-sweet oak and dusty spices. For all the richness, it's completely dry. A blend made from two of the greatest vineyards in the Russian River Valley., 96.0, 41.0
Spain, María, A meaty, bulky, earthy style of Ribera with smoky, charred, new-oak aromas setting up a reduced-seeming palate with roasted, sweet flavors of black fruits and cured meats. Feels rich, sticky and candied on the finish. Needs a couple of years to knit together; may improve with bottle age., 89.0, 102.0
France, Grand Brut Blanc, This wine is on the dry side of Brut. It is rich, at the same time crisp with a delicious creamed pear and apple flavor, lifted even further by pineapple acidity. Congratulations to Philipponnat for indicating disgorgement date and even the dosage on the back label., 93.0, 80.0
Italy, Jassarte, A blend of 20 varieties from the Mediterranean and the Caucasus, the wine's aromas are muddled: There's a bit of blackberry, plum, horsehide, cow pasture, tar and old leather in here. But this primordial brew offers a fascinating glimpse at the roots of wine., 86.0, 41.0
Italy, La Meirana Brut, Large, steely bubbles quickly rise to the surface of this pale, golden sparkling wine from northern Italy. The Brut sparkler presents simple but clean aromas of citrus, peach and yellow flower., 85.0, 21.0
France, Dom Ruinart Blanc de Blancs Brut, Made entirely from grand cru grapes, this is a beautiful wine, layering toast and ripe fruit with a proper minerality from the year.

Australia, Exile, A single-vineyard wine that contains about 85% Shiraz, 10% Mourvèdre and 5% Grenache, this is an incredibly concentrated wine. Slightly lifted aromas keep it from seeming heavy, but the flavors are dense and fudge-like, chocolaty and superripe. Dusty tannins on the finish suggest cellaring through 2010, and it should age well through at least 2020., 92.0, 160.0
US, Opulence, Opulence is the winery's reserve Syrah, and it is a robust, tooth-staining wine that takes no prisoners. Dense scents suggest a pig roast on a pile of licorice sticks; the aromas are almost visceral. The fruit has been very well handled and the tannins, though full and powerful, have been polished to a satiny sheen. There's a little chalkiness to the finish, perhaps from acidification, but that may well resolve with a little more bottle age., 91.0, 40.0
France, Les Demoiselles, In this generous and opulent wine, weight and richness accompany acidity and power. Ripe yellow and white fruits are given a touch of spice and new wood. It's gorgeous, but will be better after aging. Drink from 2018., 93.0, 380.0
Portugal, 40-year old tawny, A very old, too concentrated, medicinal, Italian bitters-flavored wine that tastes too herbal to give much pleasure. Imported by Wine Worth LLC., 83.0, 180.0
France, , Concentrated, dense and powerful, this has all the structure of a Chambertin. As a contrast, the juicy acidity cuts through the texture, luring out black fruits that balance the solid core of tannins. It needs to age for at least seven years., 92.0, 260.0
US, Independence Point, A wonderful creamy texture accompanies ripe cherry and blackberry flavors in this full-bodied, smooth and mellow wine. Rich cherry and cappucino flavors fill the corners of the mouth, mingling with a velvety layer of fine tannins., 89.0, 12.0
France, 101 Rangs, From a parcel at the highest point of the Tracy vineyard, this is a spectacular, densely mineral wine, taking its flavor from the soil. It is spicy, ripe and very full, with light tropical fruits as well as a taut and tight texture. Age for 2–3 years., 91.0, 140.0
Austria, Heiligenstein Alte Reben Reserve, Old vines on the Heiligenstein hill offer a richly textured, impressive wine. There is terrific concentration allied to fragrant acidity, hints of white flowers and apricot fruit flavors. The future for this powerfully dense wine is considerable, so don't drink before 2018., 96.0, 51.0
France, , A ripe wine, with a delicious citrus and pear character, sweet fruits and an edge of spice. Pineapple acidity gives both richness and freshness. The wine has both balance and final acidity., 93.0, 580.0
South Africa, Liber III, Herbal and green with notes of pepper, black plum skins, menthol and damp forrest floor. It's easy to drink with light tannins and a medium weight followed by a short finish., 86.0, 51.0
France, Charmes Chambertin, This is showing a mature, browning color. The palate echoes that it is just beginning to dry out, although for the next year or two it will still be a delicious, mature wine. The tannins are dark, with some sweetness as well as final acidity., 91.0, 240.0
Spain, Tinus, Everything about this stately Ribera heavyweight impresses. The nose is outright oaky, so expect derivative aromas of toast, clove, cinnamon and spice to go with black-fruit scents. This remains firm, tannic and tightly wrapped, with massive blackberry, chocolate and toast flavors. Peppery spice, brooding mixed-berry flavors and mouth-coating tannins endow a finish that signals that this has many good years ahead of it. Drink from 2018–2032., 96.0, 351.0
France, Dédicace, This 100% Chenin Blanc is a beautiful exaple of what the variety can express: soft florals loaded with garrigue notes alongside tropical fruit aromas of mango, guava and pineapple. It's vibrant in the mouth, with moderate acidity and a lifting backbone of lemon verbena. The finish lingers gracefully, and overall the wine is ripe and attractive without being sweet or cloying., 90.0, 20.0
Italy, Versace, This wine opens with funky aromas of earth, wet leaf, black raspberry, vanilla and hints of farmyard and tire rubber. The tight palate offers tart cherry, cocoa, vanilla, espresso and oak alongside drying tannins., 85.0, 31.0
US, Untamed, Dry and acidic, with dusty, sandpapery tannins, this is a distinctive wine. There's interest in the ripe red cherry and pomegranate flavors and the length of the finish. This is one of the best California Tempranillos on the market., 89.0, 22.0
Italy, Guado al Tasso, Here's a “wow” wine on every level, with incredible intensity and supple softness that builds momentum over many long minutes. A sweet cherry note at the core is surrounded by lush layers of tobacco, dark chocolate and spice, which promise to evolve gracefully over years to come., 98.0, 102.0
France, Seigneurs de Bergerac, Pears, apples and cream work well together in this friendly dry white. It has a weight, ripeness, but the acidity gives a lift. The finish is soft and full in the mouth., 84.0, 11.0
France, , This is a big, dense wine that has great generosity. It's ripe, full bodied and opulent now, and it offers concentration and depth of flavor. The fruit used to make this wine was sourced from 60-year-old vines located near Clos de Tart. It has considerable aging potential, so cellar this for 8–10 years., 97.0, 281.0
Argentina, Gran Enemigo, Round, earthy blackberry aromas are dressed up in dry spice and oak. A fleshy, pure palate has bounce to its step, while oaky, toasty flavors of baked black fruits, cocoa and spice finish with just the right amount of cutting acidity and flavors of baking spices. Drink this Cabernet Franc-led blend through 2020., 93.0, 90.0
Germany, Wildenstein R Trocken, Burnt caramel, vanilla and herbaceous dill notes lend an oaky feel to the dainty red-plum and violet flavors. The tannins are finely grained but persistent, extending the long, sour-cherry-flavored finish., 87.0, 181.0
France, Cuvée des Caudalies Grand Cru Brut Rosé, This is without question a food Champagne. Toasty on the nose and powerful and full bodied on the palate, it is rich with sweet strawberries and just a touch of toast., 90.0, 120.0
Spain, El Carretil, Jammy, concentrated aromas of boysenberry, violet petal and oak spice are about as rich and lusty as Rioja gets. This wine from a warm vintage is lush and lusty but less structured than other vintages. Jammy blackberry and blueberry flavors end in a jammy fashion. Drink through 2020., 93.0, 190.0
New Zealand, Terraces T, Brancott's top Pinot Noir is a round, mouth-filling wine that finishes tart and long. Cranberry, mocha, roasted parsnip, mushroom and smoke notes make for a complex wine that may be enjoyed now and over the next several years., 89.0, 32.0
Italy, , The Pio Cesare is dominated by the smell of diesel. Beyond that are a few shards of fruit, but overall this is a throwback for those who like the tarriness that characterized old-fashioned Barolos., 86.0, 61.0
France, Comtes de Champagne Rosé Brut, A gloriously rich rosé that is full of ripe raspberries that burst in the mouth. It has a tight texture, balanced by a rounded feel. It is still young, of course, and the sweet finish needs time to integrate. Even so, relish the wine now, or wait 3–4 years., 93.0, 290.0
France, Schoenenbourg Grand Cru, The heady scent of grapefruit and tangelo peel immediately add savoriness to the crisp green-apple fruit that is evident on the nose. But there are also richer hints of honey and yellow apple. The palate remains taut, slender and linear but that tangelo spice is boosted by enticing herbal notes of yarrow and a dollop of yeast. This is an aromatic marvel. The finish is dry and intense. This will keep your interest for years. Drink now through 2035., 95.0, 41.0
US, , With 4% Viognier giving this wine a distinct floral lift, it's aromatic with notes of nectarine, pear and toasty barrel spice. It's creamy, almost oily in feel, with an assortment of stone fruit flavors that carry through the finish., 88.0, 12.0
Spain, , Very nice red wine but for $112 we want to be forced to take notice, and frankly that doesn't really happen here. Still, the wine goes snap, crackle and pop on both the bouquet and palate. It's a crisp one, with live-wire cherry, cola and spice flavors. Not at all flabby, and instead runs lean and fresh. Good now and maybe better in a few more years., 88.0, 112.0
France, Millésime Exception Brut, This is a balanced wine, moving easily between rich fruit and a tight mineral and grapefruit texture. There is a hint of toast to give extra weight. Worth aging for several years., 92.0, 70.0
France, Clos de Mazeray, Ripe and generous, with well-integrated wood and sweet fruit, layers of strawberry and soft spice. Fresh acidity provides the balance., 87.0, 91.0
Spain, Finca El Bosque, Rich, smoky and heady, with earthy black fruit aromas that fold in mocha and vanilla. The palate runs fairly crisp and firm for a big wine, with black cherry, spice, peppercorn and herbal flavors. Super lively, tight and showing cola and lemon peel on the woody finish. Drink from 2012–2018., 92.0, 170.0
US, de Villiers Vineyard, De Villiers is one of Calera's newest vineyards, and whether it's a warmer site or simply comprised of showier clones, it's forward in raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with lots of sweet, caramelized oak. The finish is long and sweet in fruit, and the alcohol is well below 14% by volume., 89.0, 42.0
Germany, Hochheimer Domdechaney Beerenauslese, A wonderfully drinkable beerenauslese, which makes it a serious accomplishment—sometimes these wines can just be too much. This one balances its intense dried apricot and golden raisin notes with tropical and citrus fruit and lively acidity., 96.0, 271.0
US, Mo Zin, Tastes like orange, apricot and cherry sweet-and-sour sauce you get in a Chinese restaurant over pork or chicken. The flavors are of those fruits, with some white sugar and rice vinegar., 80.0, 20.0
Italy, Guado al Tasso, Guado al Tasso is a wine that will make you fall uncontrollably in love with Italy. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot are expertly blended to produce amazing intensity, purity and texture. You'll appreciate aromas of mineral, ripe fruit, leather, tobacco and chocolate., 97.0, 102.0
US, Ferrington Vineyard, Very dry and elegantly silky, this Pinot, from one of the best vineyards in the valley, brims with cherry, red currant, cola, licorice and peppery spice flavors. Seems at its best now and in the short term., 89.0, 52.0
France, , Light, fresh, fruity wine, with a smoky complexity. The acidity and red currants are more intense than the dry structure. The whole wine is tight, stalky, finishing with toughness., 85.0, 51.0
France, Les Folatières Premier Cru, A beautifully shaped wine that exudes richness balanced with lively fresh fruits. There is a tautness and minerality that adds complexity to the pineapple and spice flavors. The wine opens well in the mouth, ripeness and full fruit flavors melding easily. Delicious., 93.0, 101.0
Austria, Poharnig, Pungent and herbal, with grassy notes that overlay bright lime fruit and a solid mineral base. Structured, this could age nicely over the next 5–8 years, much like a good Bordeaux blanc., 88.0, 32.0
Germany, Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese, Sweet and savory interplay through this exotic TBA, balancing waves of candied orange rind and caramelized sugar with umami-rich notes of sea breeze and dried herb. It's delicate on the palate, but lingers long with bright tangerine acidity. Delicious now, but would be fascinating to try in 10 years., 92.0, 670.0
US, Pepper Bridge Vineyard Apogee, First to arrive, straight to your awaiting nose, are complex aromatics, with a mix of floral and spicy highlights that surround the black and purple fruits with exotic nuances. The fruit is nigh perfect—ripe, round, forward and loaded with plummy, sweet berries. It gathers strength in the core, holds, and then expands into a finish dusted with cocoa and coffee., 91.0, 50.0
France, , This offers a firm, dense structure, with dark tannins and big, ripe, opulent fruits. At the same time the elegance that is the hallmark of the domaine is equally present with stylish red fruits and a velvet texture. The wine needs to age to be at its peak, although it is beautiful now. Drink from 2020., 96.0, 281.0
Austria, Cécile, A firmly tannic, young Pinot Noir with red berry fruits under this strong surface dryness. As it develops over the next year, it will become a more elegant, balanced wine, but never one with great power. Cécile is Willi Bründlmayer's daughter., 89.0, 62.0
France, Marquis de Laguiche Premier Cru Morgeot, The Marquis de Laguiche vineyards, with a great stock of premier and grand crus, have long been managed by Drouhin. This wood-aged, generous and opulent wine is already smooth and rich. Yellow fruits have a tight, tense texture to go with their open character. The wine is just beginning to develop its intense complexity. Drink from 2019., 94.0, 131.0
US, Reserve, Floral aromas greet the nose before exuberant, juicy dark cherry fruit comes into play in this full-bodied red. Tight-grained tannins lend strength and structure beneath a backdrop of cedar and dried herb flavors., 91.0, 150.0
South Africa, Petit, A well-made blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 41% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 1% Barbera, this value wine is a stunner with black cherry, plum and cassis notes surprisingly spiced with accents of mint and flint. Creamy in the mouth with medium-grain tannins and a solid finish., 87.0, 12.0
Germany, Serrig Schloss Saarsteiner Beerenauslese Goldkapsel, Like all of the Schloss's noble sweet wines, this one isn't overblown, displaying ample sweetness but also zesty acidity. There's a slight greenish hint to the candied citrus and dried pineapple flavors, with a lemony streak on the finish that balances the sweetness impeccably. Should last for 40–50 years—possibly more—in a cool cellar., 94.0, 231.0
US, Reserve, A heavy, soft wine. It shows the weight, density and ripeness of a Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot Noir, with black cherry, mocha and spice flavors, but lacks delicacy and vivacity. Drink now., 84.0, 31.0
Italy, Val di Suga, This attractive Brunello presents a wild, brambly side, with aromas of wild mushroom, forest floor, small berry and crème de cassis. It boasts a beautiful, deep color and plenty of concentration, with endnotes of spice, leather and dried tobacco leaf. The mouthfeel is solid, well defined and superbly structured., 95.0, 61.0
US, Chileno Valley Vineyard, The acidity is high in this vibrant Pinot Noir, giving it a tart, bracing mouthfeel. Then there's the fruit, suggesting mashed red cherries with the skins, anise, cola and black pepper. It's an interesting wine from a cool-climate region whose potential is just beginning to be explored., 88.0, 42.0
Germany, Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese, Hugely sweet yet reasonably balanced given its enormous concentration, this is a tremendous example of the quality heights sweet Riesling can achieve. Golden raisin, dried apricots and candied pineapple all swirl together in a delicious haze of sugar-coma-inducing syrup that nevertheless goes down easily. Will age easily for decades., 97.0, 612.0
France, , Concentrated and complex, this has structure and acidity, with a black cherry flavor. It's a ripe, powerful wine that could become more generous as it ages., 89.0, 72.0
US, , Craig's Howell Mountain Cab typically is powerful and ripe, with bigtime tannins that require aging. The 2005 is such a wine. Made with a drop of Merlot, it shows black cherry and cassis fruit accented with lots of toasty new oak. But it's really young, stinging the palate with astringency. Should negotiate the next 10 years with ease., 92.0, 80.0
US, Reserve West Dry Creek, As sweet as Port, with chocolate and prune flavors. Feels as hot as a chile pepper, with nearly 17% alcohol., 81.0, 50.0
France, , For a Grand Cru from Vosne-Romanée, this is a wine on the light side, its tannins soft and dominated by new-wood flavors. That said, it is still a fine wine, packed with ripe fruit and fresh acidity. The structure floats over the fruit; a few months and it may fatten out., 91.0, 350.0
Chile, Viñedo Chadwick, Haven't seen this excellent wine in a couple of vintages, and while the $180 price tag is sky high there's no denying the wine's quality, which centers around cedar and tobacco aromas and fine core fruit. Flavors and aromas of cassis, berry and plum have tobacco and balsamic accents, while the feel is warm and lush but structured., 92.0, 180.0
US, Maritime Vineyard, The first thoughts on this wine are how young it is, and how much potential it shows. The immaturity lies in the primary fruit, acidic character, like a big gulp of fruity cola. But the wine's awesome future is in its vast complexity and balance, and the way it dominates the palate and lasts and lasts. A blend of several vineyards, it's high in acidity, with massive cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb preserve, licorice, earthy mushroom and cedar flavors. So balanced and dry, so elegant and powerful, so silky and complex, it is quite simply a very great Pinot Noir, and an early indication that the vintage on the far Sonoma Coast may be the greatest ever. Tasted twice., 98.0, 52.0
US, , Nice nose of toast, milk chocolate, confected strawberries and powdered sugar. Light fruits (pomegranate, strawberry) dusted with cocoa and hinting at some of the tobacco notes of Italian Sangiovese., 87.0, 22.0
France, Les Millandes Premier Cru, Austere and mineral initially, this is a complex wine, showing Asian spices as well as dark plum and berry fruits. It is layered with powerful tannins, which give the wine almost as much structure as fruit. A powerhouse that will age well., 92.0, 280.0
Portugal, 30-year old tawny, A fine, sweet, fresh wine, which tastes younger than 30 years. The flavors are ripe, layering milk chocolate with acidity in good balance., 87.0, 122.0
US, Barlow Vineyards, Grippy with tar notes and tannin, this full-bodied wine offers ripe blackberry, currant and licorice highlights before giving in to its richness with dark chocolate renderings., 88.0, 52.0
Spain, Unico, Hailing from the hottest vintage in years, this is round, rubbery and showing sweet, rooty aromas of root beer, cola, mocha and stewed plum. Dense but soft, it has rubbery, savory flavors of barbecue sauce, herbal plum, tomato and carob. An earthy, loamy, chunky finish offers tobacco and baking spice accents. Drink through 2020., 91.0, 450.0
US, , From the get-go this wine has disturbing notes. The aroma is raw, and once in the mouth, the wine turns astringently tannic and harsh. Despite a core of blackberry fruit, it's not likely to improve., 82.0, 80.0
France, , Firmly tannic and powerful, this is dominated by a plum skin texture and a spice note. It's dense and rich, with a dry structure and the acidity of the vintage showing on the finish., 94.0, 141.0
Austria, Zöbinger Heiligenstein Erste Lage Lyra Reserve, Called Lyra because of the lyre-shaped vine training, this is a classic wine. Still very closed, it is currently all potential. The acidity, the tight and taut texture, and the hidden richness all point to a wine with a great future. Drink from 2017., 95.0, 71.0
Spain, Vertus Crianza Wine Made with Organically Grown Grapes, Burnt and leathery smelling, with aromas of earth, rubber and baked fruit. It feels rough and grabby, with dry spice, cinnamon and roasted berry flavors. The finish is abrasive, with some warmth., 83.0, 11.0
France, Grand Cru Clos Saint-Urbain Rangen de Thann, This is a wonderful wine, which comes from the vineyard in the south of Alsace that the Humbrechts brought back from obscurity. It has both intensity and also great elegance. It has flavors of currants, layers of orange zest and some fresh acidity. But it also has spice which lies gently with the fruit flavors. The taste just goes on forever., 96.0, 102.0
US, Riverview Vineyard, This is a very ripe, fruity Chardonnay, and also a very oaky one. It tastes like apricot brûlée. It will satisfy fans of this California style, but is really fairly simple., 84.0, 41.0
France, Le Méal, Le Méal is said to be the warmest terroir on the Hermitage hill, and thus it is no surprise that this bottling fared the best in the challenging 2004 vintage. Flamboyant, creamy waves of raspberry fruit flood the palate, bringing hints of meat, smoke and pepper along for the ride and developing lovely soft tannins on the caressing finish. Approachable now, but should age well through 2020., 96.0, 202.0
US, Ponzo Vineyard, Brawny, briary, rustic, tannic, fruity, these are just a few words to describe this wine. It's a true barbecue companion, a big, powerful, full-bodied wine with blackberry and pepper flavors. Drink now and through 2012., 87.0, 32.0
US, , This wine shows intense bittersweet tobacco and dried herb flavors, wrapped in a subtle greenness. Dense and rich, it presents its ripe and full-bodied weight with a leathery texture on the palate., 88.0, 62.0
US, Estate, From the wildest, most remote and exotic stretch of the Sonoma Coast: you can taste the salt of the sea in this wine, as you can in a Manzanilla Sherry. It gives a tang to the lemondrop, pear and honeysuckle flavors, with their lick of cold granite. So pure and vibrant, so savory, so compelling. Grows more fascinating with every minute in the glass., 97.0, 42.0
US, Bergström Vineyard, Sourced entirely from the biodynamic estate vineyard, this extraordinary wine delivers compact, complex, detailed aromas and flavors in perfect proportion. The blueberry and cherry fruit is wreathed in dried herbs and flowers. Fourteen months in French oak, roughly half new, adds a thread of vanilla bean. Loads of dried extract, polished tannins and moist earth bring in more nuances., 95.0, 81.0
Germany, Zeltinger Sonnenuhr Auslese, Pristine apple, pear and peach are marked with hints of nuts and crushed stones in this sprightly yet deeply complex auslese. It's lacy and sheer on the palate, yet lime and lemon tones are bracing. Hold till 2020 to allow the subtleties to intensify., 94.0, 51.0
France, , Dusty tannins and juicy fruit reveal the great freshness of the wine. While it does not have great density of flavor, it does have plenty of forward fruit, smoky flavors and black currant acidity. For the medium term., 88.0, 72.0
Italy, Cerretta, Aromas include rose petal, grilled herb, forest floor, coffee and ripe berry. The palate is still rather closed but offers black cherry, vanilla and espresso alongside astringent tannins that give it an abrupt, drying finish., 89.0, 103.0
US, C'est Syrah Magnifique, Finished in French oak, the Magnifique bottling from Walter Dacon seems a bit plain, almost generic in this vintage. Red fruit, noticeably high alcohol (14.8%) that you can taste, and tongue-scraping astringency suggest that this may need significantly more bottle age to pull itself together., 87.0, 42.0
Australia, Barrel Fermented, A bright pear and cinnamon nose opens this attractive, medium-weight wine. The palate shows peach and pear flavors, supported by brisk—some might say sharp—acidity, but flabby it isn't. Shows good balance and a nice long spicy finish, where the oak comes on strong., 86.0, 12.0
Italy, Pergole Vece, This has aromas of ripe—just shy of overripe—black fruit that recall plum preserves. The palate is rich, with flavors of mature black cherry, prune and chocolate bar. This lacks complexity and restraint, but is big, lush and decadent., 87.0, 142.0
France, Domaine des Perdrix Les 8 Ouvrées Aux Perdrix Premier Cru, This rich, fruity wine wears its wood aging right up front, with spice and a toast character. A flavor of black plum juice comes through, offering a full character and rounding out the structure. Age for at least five years., 93.0, 121.0
Italy, Famiglia Pasqua Riserva, This is a massive wine on all levels, from the heavy black bottle and heavy wax seal, to the enormous richness and intensity of the liquid inside. Despite its heft and brawn, the wine also shows an elegant side thanks to a careful evolution over the years that has added tones of licorice and cola to the natural base of ripe fruit., 92.0, 90.0
Portugal, Vinha do Fojo, Smells a bit underripe, with weedy, green notes that ride atop sour cherries. Tart and sour-tasting, yet it does pick up an intriguing licorice note on the finish. Not bad, but not worthy of its reputation., 84.0, 51.0
France, Clos de Vougeot, Tannins and dark fruit dominate this concentrated, dense wine. The weight of ripe black fruit shows straight through the structure. This is for long term aging., 92.0, 190.0
Italy, Marina Cvetic', This thick, luscious and opulent Trebbiano d'Abruzzo shows the best of white wine making in central Italy. There's complexity and balance here all backed by beautifully intense aromas of stone fruit, toasted almond and exotic fruit., 91.0, 60.0
Chile, Armador, Big and ripe, with inviting aromas of cola, mint, dark chocolate and black fruit. The feel and flow on the wine are just right, while the blackberry and chocolate chip-mint flavors are tasty and even a bit complex. Long and layered on the finish, with a round, succulent final wave of meaty, serious flavors., 89.0, 13.0
US, Trenton Estate Vineyard, An awesome Pinot Noir—it's hard to find words to describe its beauty. It's bone dry and rich in stimulating acidity, and the cherry and raspberry fruit flavors have an earthy, mushroomy quality that grounds the wine and gives it a real sense of terroir. Shows the fleshy attractions of the amazing '07 vintage, with an undisputed capacity to age. Now–2017, at least., 97.0, 52.0
France, Pitois Premier Cru, Joseph Belland is based in neighboring Santenay, where the estate produces red wines. But this wine, from right next door in Chassagne, is a fine, ripe wine with some vanilla aromas and a rich texture balanced by some easy acidity., 88.0, 82.0
France, Les Cèdres, Despite only 15% new oak, this wine comes across as toasty and caramelly, with delicate touches of pear, honey and wet stones. There's plenty of weight and length, so fans of oaked whites will find plenty to like., 87.0, 52.0
Germany, Wehlener Sonnenuhr Vat 10 Riesling Beerenauslese, Viscous, almost oily in texture, this is several vintages older than most of the recent samples, yet seems so unevolved that it's not out of place. Honey and dried spices are the predominant themes, with citrusy fruit making up the core. Should evolve glacially through at least 2025., 91.0, 160.0
US, , A vegetal note mars this Cabernet, giving it a steamed asparagus note to the blackberry jam flavor., 82.0, 90.0
US, Blackbird, While smoke and char notes are prominent on the nose, there's plenty of concentrated blackberry and cherry flavor in this medium-bodied red. It's fleshy and rich on the palate, but balanced out nicely by zesty strikes of cranberry acidity and fine, feathery tannins., 86.0, 22.0
Chile, Reserva Especial, Heavily toasted, but with minerality the nose works. The palate starts with forward woodiness, but soon thereafter apple and green banana flavors push the oak aside. Very nice in terms of feel even if the acidity keeps it cranking. Additional resin and vanilla take over on the finish. A better wine with less oak? You be the judge., 89.0, 23.0
Italy, Vigna del Gris, Oak, roasted coffee bean and coconut aromas lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry, exotic spice, oak extract and espresso alongside astringent wood tannins that dry out the mouth. There's not quite enough fruit richness to stand up to the oak., 88.0, 92.0
US, Laetitia Vineyard, This exceedingly rich wine is produced from fruit grown in the cool-climate Laetitia Vineyard, which is better known for Pinot Noir than for Syrah. The maritime influence can be tasted in the acidity, which is bright and citrusy, and it provides a firm backbone to the ripe black-cherry, red currant, licorice, bacon, black pepper and cedar flavors. Drink this over the next five years., 90.0, 30.0
Germany, Berg Roxheim GG Trocken, This wine makes an interesting contrast to the estate's GG from the Wallhausen Johannisberg—it's seemingly much tighter. There's passion fruit and fern fronds, wrapped in crisp acids that leave the wine finishing long, but tart and scoury., 87.0, 62.0
Spain, Tinto Figuero Noble, A touch doughy on the nose, with prune and blackberry aromas that are neither pushy nor aggressive. The palate is ripe, rich and just forward enough, with blackberry, wild berry, coffee and fudge flavors. Settles nicely on the finish, and overall this wine shows almost all of what's good about modern Ribera del Duero wines. 250 cases made; drink now through 2015., 93.0, 131.0
US, Estate Bottled, Gary Eberle's Paso Robles Cabernet has been consistent over many years, and his '06 bottling shows off his understanding. It's a soft, pleasant wine that offers waves of blackberry jam, black currant, cocoa and cedar flavors, with an elegantly drinkable mouthfeel. Nice with barbecued steak and garlic-rosemary roasted new potatoes., 89.0, 33.0
Austria, Zwischen den Steen Nummer 8 Trockenbeerenauslese, The intensity of the acidity, piercing through the sweetness, is what is astonishing about this wine. It gives the wine an ethereal quality, a lightness to go with the concentration of the dried fruits and orange zest flavors. The essence of TBA., 98.0, 103.0
US, Todd Brothers Ranch Old Vines, Something of a fruit bomb, with massive cherry, raspberry, currant, mocha and granola flavors, wrapped into a lightly tannic body. Brisk acidity fortunately provides balance to the fruit. Drink now., 86.0, 32.0
Portugal, 30-Year-Old Tawny, Remarkably, this is able to show age and long cask aging, but the flavor is still here: figs and honey, balanced out with burnt caramel aged acidity and a rich (but not sweet) finish. Excellent, top quality aged tawny., 95.0, 102.0
US, Hirsch Vineyard, Dazzles with richness, offering waves of candied, tart raspberry and cherry fruit, Dr. Pepper, exotic Indian spice, rose petal and sandalwood flavors, as well as undefinable feral things. Absolutely dry and high in acidity, with overwhelming complexity, it's a milestone. Drink now through 2014; could go way beyond., 97.0, 72.0
France, Brut Rosé, Clean, simple, fresh and very pink.  Don't analyze this wine too much; it's a somewhat sweet bubbly that's made to please the masses.  Melon and peach flavors come with a forceful bead.  Pink grapefruit is the dominant flavor.  Pleasant enough for cocktail parties., 83.0, 31.0
France, , Richly endowed, the wine is beautifully concentrated. Still young it has considerable potential with its rich fruits and firm tannins. There is a strongly juicy aftertaste that brings in the freshness of the year. The wine will age well, and should not be drunk before 2026., 95.0, 202.0
France, Diamant Rosé, Overt and round, with chunky aromas of berries and stone fruits. Quite lively and zesty, with purity of flavors. Is it a touch limited in scope and complexity? Yes. But the nectarine and orange flavors are crystalline and the mouthfeel rocks. Imported by Vranken America., 90.0, 130.0
US, Coastlands Vineyard, Rather heavy in texture, a big, full-bodied and tannic Pinot that seems overly extracted and oaky. The vintage was very difficult due to early September heat waves, and everything depended on exquisite timing. It's very good, despite the rusticity. Drink now through 2012., 87.0, 72.0
Portugal, Batuta, A great wine, which has the richness and the intense concentration of the Douro with a world-class style. This blend of Douro grapes is full of black fruits, of new wood flavors, of solid, dry tannins. But it also has tastes of prunes, of brooding dark fruits and balancing acidity. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest wines from the Douro., 94.0, 71.0
US, , An extraordinary Cabernet that stands out even in this great vintage, and among its Rutherford peers. Quite dry and tannic in youth, it shows an astringency that strongly suggests the cellar. Underneath are powerhouse flavors of blackberries, black and red cherries, spices, tea and cedar. Really defines balance and elegance in a Napa Cabernet. Decant if you drink it now, but it should develop for years to come., 96.0, 42.0
France, Assemblage Brut, This is a powerful, almost concentrated, very dry selection. Its richness comes from the weight of its fruit flavors and the tight tang of its intense acidity. From a fine vintage, it could still age for several more years. Disgorged July 2011., 92.0, 101.0
France, Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs Brut, The latest release of the legendary Comtes de Champagne comes from a great vintage. It has full, toasty bottle-age notes that give the wine depth of flavor, with a ripe, rounded mouthfeel and taut acidity. An almond note combines with the citrus-driven acidity on the finish., 94.0, 171.0
Portugal, Grand'Arte Arinto, Crisp, structured wine, showing the fruit skin and bite that makes Arinto such an interesting variety. There is an orange zest edge, emphasizing lightness, freshness, finishing a delicious wine., 88.0, 13.0
US, Sonoma Stage Vineyard, Previous vintages tasted more balanced than this super-oaky one. The wood erupts from the glass, suggestive of caramel, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream pie and charcoal, overwhelming what seems to be a perfectly nice wine. Some folks will love it. Others will find it the poster child of overoaked California Chard., 86.0, 42.0
US, Allen Vineyard, A drop-dead gorgeous Pinot Noir that will satisfy everyone from Burgundy fans to diehard Cabernet cultists. Show an elegant complexity and silky texture that define great California Pinot Noir, yet with a powerful impact that emphasizes raspberries, cherries and blueberries. Brilliant acidity and tannins provide the perfect framework on this wine that's drinkable now, and will develop over the next 15–20 years., 97.0, 82.0
Italy, Kupra, Made with Bordò (a biotype of Grenache) in limited case production, Kupra is a special wine that is clearly designed to showcase the potential of winemaking in the Marche, Central Italy. The wine is crisp, clean and elegant with a long assembly of aromas that span from cherry and cinnamon to crushed white stone and white pepper. The close is smooth and elegant., 90.0, 230.0
Italy, Ambruco, This has bright aromas of maraschino, tobacco, bitter chocolate, prune and dusty mineral. There's a tightness to the mouthfeel that is reinforced by acidity and long-lasting berry flavors., 89.0, 53.0
Hungary, Red Label Aszú 5 Puttonyos - 500 ml, A deep, lush nose of honey, marmalade and lemon leads into fresh, bright fruit and acid undertones melded with luscious honey, orange peel and quince. A lingering finish spun with spice adds to the complex, elegant nature. Pair with cheeses, foie gras., 93.0, 41.0
US, Reserve, Shockingly overpriced. Tough, dry and tannic, with raisiny flavors. Why would anyone buy this wine?, 82.0, 101.0
France, , The superb Clos de la Roche has produced a powerful and complex wine. It has concentrated black fruits and solid tannins while also showing a beautiful velvet texture that will develop into a sumptuous wine. It's still in the first youthful flush and needs many years. Drink from 2020., 95.0, 312.0
Portugal, Duas Quintas Branco, This is a bright lemon and grapefruit flavored wine that has lively acidity and the lightest touch of mineral texture. It's crisp, refreshing and will be ready to drink from mid-2016., 85.0, 12.0
France, Les Forts de Latour, Mint aromas hint at the wood, but more important is the massive Merlot fruit that is an essential element in the blend. The result is a wine that blends richness and power with an initially severe character. Slowly it opens to reveal opulent blackberry jam flavors, immensely ripe., 95.0, 412.0
US, , Ripe and classy, this wine, with a little Cabernet, captures the rich power of a fine Bordeaux blend. It's very dry, and has intricate, dusty tannins that frame blackberry, cherry, mocha, dried herb and oaky spice flavors. Easy to find, with 15,300 cases produced., 88.0, 23.0
Germany, Wallhausen Felseneck GG Trocken, The entire flight of Prinz Salm's 2009 GG was something of a letdown, including this astronomically priced sample. It's good, but nothing more, combining subtle apple and citrus notes with hints of petrol. Feels lean and crisp despite the 13.5% abv, so perhaps it just needs more time to develop., 85.0, 112.0
France, Les Clos Grand Cru, A wine in two parts. It opens soft, with attractive green and white fruits. Then a tight, steely grip shows through, offering aging as well as a taut mineral character. Give the wine 4–5 years., 94.0, 81.0
US, Stone Corral Vineyard, Few Pinots are this forward and rich in raspberry and cherry jam and softened cola flavors. It's instantly luscious, but soft, and lacking the balance for aging. Drink up., 86.0, 52.0
Italy, Podere Bellarina, This 2006 Brunello delivers loads of rich intensity, chocolate fudge, ripe cherry and tobacco, with soft, velvety tones at the back. It's a bold, masculine wine with an attractive personality., 91.0, 70.0
US, Tears of Dew Late Harvest, With 21% residual sugar, this is an enormously sweet wine, one of the most honeyed of the vintage. A little sugar goes a long way, of course, but this wine also charms with rich, powerful apricot, peach and vanilla custard flavors, perfectly balanced with crisp acidity. With consistently high scores over the years, Tears of Dew has taken a place in the front ranks of California dessert white wines., 95.0, 22.0
Argentina, Ciclos Fumé, Smells like a can of green beans, or maybe it's canned peas. Either way, the nose is a siren call of what's to come: celery, acid, lime, asparagus and canned peas. No thank you., 80.0, 30.0
Italy, , This elegant red offers aromas and flavors of toast, raspberry, sour cherry, espresso and white pepper. Firm, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2019., 88.0, 33.0
France, Schlossberg Grand Cru Cuvée Saint Catherine, Faint notes of ripe pear are only hinted at on the nose but on the dry palate they open up into pure, textured, precisely drawn fruit. There is concentration and a heady, seductive lemon and pear perfume hovering over the concentrated, profound palate of wet stone and immensely pure lemon oil. This comes on light, delicate feet but leaves you with a deep, lasting and impressive memory of Riesling purity and elegance., 96.0, 62.0
Spain, , Charcoal aromas shadow standard black fruit scents. This is forward in its approach, with a sturdy mouthfeel. Black plum and blackberry flavors feature a lot of vanilla and cream, while the finish is mild, straightforward and tastes mostly like oak and associated vanilla. Drink now through 2020., 89.0, 73.0
US, Estate, From a warmish Monterey County appellation comes this soft, creamy Chard. It has pretty flavors of very ripe white peaches and apricots, drizzled with vanilla, and seems a little sweet., 85.0, 22.0
US, , After encountering this tannic wine, you're left wondering if the cellar will be kind to it. Probably, but it's not a slam-dunk. It's tough and gritty, and you have to chew on it to release the black currants from their cage. Hold until 2008 and try again., 86.0, 62.0
Austria, Dürnsteiner Hollerin Smaragd, Bright and dry, this is a mineral, structured wine. The freshness comes from the green apple skin flavors, as well as the initially overwhelming acidity, which carries delicious citrus and white currant crispness., 93.0, 51.0
France, Clos Himmelreich, Minerality and spicy smoke paired with soft Bartlett pear are a nice introduction, followed by flavors of limey citrus, honeydew and petrol. A lean and refreshing wine with a clean snappy finish., 87.0, 103.0
France, Cristal Brut, This is a lightweight Cristal, floating and fresh, without the punch this great wine can have from Pinot Noir. It is also way too young. To taste, there is good balance, but the persistent grapefruit flavor shows the wine's youth., 92.0, 211.0
US, , Silverado flies under the radar, quietly producing opulent and balanced Cabernets while others get their 15 minutes. The '04 is riper and softer than previous vintages, with jammy blackberry, cherry, blueberry and smoky oak flavors, but it maintains balance and elegance. Drink now., 88.0, 43.0
Italy, Liste, Some lifted notes join tar and floral aromas on the nose while the concentrated palate shows intense earth and rose flavors in a frame of polished tannins. Mineral and tar flavors come through on the lingering finish. Best after 2010., 89.0, 83.0
US, Wallula Vineyard Biodynamic, Made from grapes sourced from a biodynamically farmed vineyard, this wine puts on an almost-magical display of flower and citrus scents. Deep and concentrated, this has harmonious and potent flavors, and it is amazing how the delicate floral aspect cuts across the juicy, citrusy taste., 95.0, 32.0
US, Resonance Reserve, This is Sineann's first reserve, a limited release from some old vine blocks from one of Oregon's greatest Pinot vineyards, now fully biodynamic. As good as the “regular” Resonance is, this ramps it up another notch or two. The fruit ranges from cherry to prune; the acids are perfect, the barrel notes so well-concealed that you cannot separate them out. Streaks of cherry, fig, coffee, smoke, chocolate, bourbon, caramel—where do you stop? It just goes and goes. Phenomenal winemaking., 96.0, 72.0
Italy, Pergole Vece, The fruit-driven- intensity and general youthfulness of this Amarone promise a very long future. It's well-built and bold, with a rich, chewy mouthfeel and lively aromas of leather, spice, plum, dark fruit and tobacco. It goes down beautifully, leaving a long endnote of divine chocolate fudge., 95.0, 132.0
Chile, Santa Digna Selection Rosé, Not too bad on the nose but tangy, jumpy and overexcited in the mouth, with exaggerated nectarine and citrus flavors. Aggressive after the bouquet, with no elegance. Year after year this wine is lively but fails to impress us., 82.0, 11.0
US, Lia's Vineyard Jory Slope, Short, sharp and attenuated, this has a volatile edge to its aromas, and that sharpness carries over into the palate., 85.0, 32.0
Spain, Alba de Breton, There's no shortage of ripe aromas: leather, berries and aged cheese. Yet the palate is quite sharp, with searing acidity sitting on top of red-berry flavors. This wine has unlimited aging potential, but will it ever taste great? That remains to be seen., 86.0, 72.0
Spain, Campo Burgo Crianza, Opens with rubber, smoke, leather and coffee aromas, then the fruit comes in on the palate, which is juicy and correct, with tight, fresh red-fruit flavors and notes of ripe tomato and pepper flake. Finishes spicy and dry, with a crispness that'll make it 100% food-friendly., 87.0, 13.0
Italy, , This base Barolo from Bel Colle opens with slightly muddled aromas of cured ham, ripe fruit and exotic spice. It scored the same as this estate's 2007 Barbaresco Roncaglie although the finish is perhaps more elegant and refined on this wine., 88.0, 53.0
Argentina, Firmado, This is a pushy wine with aromas of rubber, pencil eraser, leather, blueberry and oak. It has the tannic grip that creates a certain roughness, while blueberry and spice flavors have fire to them, especially on the finish.., 89.0, 93.0
US, Allen Vineyard, You can taste the California sun in every sip of this gorgeous Pinot Noir. It brims with luscious raspberries and cherries accented by brisk acidity and a hint of sweet, smoky oak. It's terrifically complex, with notes of mushroom, orange zest, cola, rosehip tea and persimmon. Dry and elegant, with a wonderful mouthfeel, it's gorgeous now, but will gain earthy complexity over the next 15 years., 96.0, 82.0
US, Fog-Eater, A stunning Pinot Noir, and a worthy followup to Drew's 2006 bottling. Interestingly, the official alcohol is nearly 1% lower at no loss of ripeness, a testimony to the success of the vintage. Offers everything you want in a fine coastal Pinot: crisp acidity, a dry, silky mouthfeel, refined tannins, complexity and ageability. The flavors include red cherries and currants, cola, sassafras, red licorice and Asian spices. Great now and through 2013., 95.0, 42.0
Germany, Kiedrich Turmberg Auslese, Terrific, from its nearly indefinable aromas akin to Cloud Ear fungus to its intensely sweet yet racy palate. Dried apricot, peach and pineapple flavors give it substance without excessive weight, finishing long and intense. Drink now–2030., 95.0, 142.0
France, Domaine de Roure, With its soft tannins and slightly creamy texture, the open-knit 2006 Domaine de Roure is very approachable now. Vanilla and plum notes come across as slightly oaky, but hints of olive and espresso emerge on the finish. Drink now–2015., 88.0, 63.0
Spain, Colección Jaime Rodríguez, Smooth berries and plenty of dark licorice carry the seductive bouquet. And seeing that this is Remelluri's signature high-priced red, you should expect the fine berry, plum and chocolate flavors that rest comfortably on the palate. But like many '02s, the wine has a hard mouthfeel and pronounced acidity, so it doesn't quite trigger all the pleasure points that it might in a better vintage., 89.0, 104.0
France, Genevrières Premier Cru, Relatively closed up at this stage, not giving much, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development. The wood is quite prominent, overshadowing what will be delicious yellow-fruit flavors. Come back to this wine in five years—it will be magnificent., 94.0, 102.0
US, J.D. Hurley, Martin Ranch makes a consistently good Merlot, this one marked by sweet red fruit and licorice, with layers of cinnamon spice. Full-bodied and meaty, its layers are concentrated enough to stand up to steak or hamburgers., 87.0, 23.0
US, Broken Rock Vineyard, Chocolate-covered cherry and plum surround a shock of stark acidity on this wine that has a round and soft palate. On the finish, a touch of astringency flirts with cedar., 86.0, 82.0
US, Block 19 Syrah Weinbau Vineyard, The oak (40% new French) steals the show on this vineyard-designated, single block Syrah with notes of vanilla and toast overwhelming the vintage's subtle fruit flavors., 85.0, 42.0
France, , The beautifully perfumed Gros Manseng should, by rights, be as popular as Chardonnay. This medium-sweet wine is all apricots, pears and honey, with a delicious fresh waft of acidity. Screwcap., 89.0, 14.0
Austria, Ried Loibenberg Reserve, Lusciously ripe, almost honeyed, pear fruit emanates from the glass. Underneath that is grapefruit zest and pith and a herbal, stony, earthy edge. The palate is rich and curvaceous but completely toned by a pervasive, lemony acidity that lends drive and linearity. This is already approachable, which is not to say that it doesn't promise a lot of mileage: this will go on and unfold its facets of fruit. Immense charm almost plays over the fact that this is a very age-worthy wine, with a finish that's almost endless. Drink from 2017., 96.0, 92.0
Italy, Luigi Einaudi, An equiproportioned blend of Nebbiolo, Barbera, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, you can taste each of the components in the finished wine: earth, cherries, tobacco and cassis, and plums, respectively. It's deceptively easy to drink, with broad, expansive tannins on the finish. You could drink it now, but it should be even better in a few years' time., 88.0, 73.0
France, Le Viala, Garrigue herb and purple flower aromas harmonize seamlessly with the lush black-berry preserves, boysenberry and raspberry fruit core. Ripe fruit flavors continue through to the creamy palate, framed by medium tannins and ample acidity. Notes of black pepper, cherry skin and bittersweet cocoa linger long on the finish., 91.0, 80.0
US, Quaglia Vineyard, You can taste the warm sunshine in the spicy berry flavors of this Zin. It comes right up to the edge of overripe, with suggestions of bitter raisins, then pulls back to let the cassis and cherry liqueur shine through., 87.0, 33.0
Italy, San Lorenzo Gran Selezione, Impeccably balanced and extremely elegant, this opens with a multifaceted fragrance of perfumed berry, crushed blue flower, menthol, baking spice and just a hint of new leather. The graceful palate offers layers of succulent wild cherry, white pepper, licorice, mint and eucalyptus alongside firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's sleek and already tempting but hold for complexity. Drink 2016–2030., 95.0, 52.0
France, Louise, This is a delicate style of wine, very classic Pommery. But it does have delicious, crisp fruit, apples and cream flavors. It is still young, very fresh and green—needs more time in the bottle., 91.0, 180.0
Italy, Bricco Rocche Bricco Rocche, Nebbiolo grapes, with their naturally elegant aromas of black currant and licorice, speak loudly. So does winery magic: Tones of spice, leather, cola and tobacco are derived from 24 months of careful oak aging. The tannins are fine and tight and this wine will age ten years or more., 95.0, 252.0
Portugal, Curva Reserva, Fresh, despite the dense tannin, this is a ripe, juicy wine, full of black currant flavors and vibrant acidity. Wood treatment shows more cassis just at the end to round the wine out., 89.0, 24.0
Italy, , This is a ripe and thickly extracted wine with sweet aromas of cherry liqueur, moist tobacco, cured meat and exotic spice. It's big and bold on all levels and needs to be paired with an equally succulent food like grilled steak. You'll get chocolate, espresso and mesquite over the wine's rich and velvety close., 94.0, 112.0
US, , Soft and candied in raspberry and cherry granola flavors, this Cabernet has very smooth tannins. It's delicious, but a bit too sweet and one-dimensional., 85.0, 52.0
Spain, Aurus, One half of the wine is lush and opulent, the other juicy, fresh and pulsing with the essence of old-vines Rioja fruit. So for every note of molasses, burnt toast, chocolate or baked berry pie, there's a twinge of acidity, a spike of tannin and a dollop of earthy terroir. Tempranillo with 15% Graciano. 500 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc., 94.0, 212.0
France, , This perfumed, smoky wine is gently wood aged and offers layers of tannin and black cherry fruits. It is still young and dense, dark and dry, with piercing acidity. It is concentrated, firm and needs time. Drink from 2019., 94.0, 312.0
France, Pierrefolle, Very crisp and apple flavored, it has bright acidity and a light, gentle texture of minerality. It is ready to drink now, although waiting until 2015 will bring out more depth of flavor., 87.0, 43.0
Austria, Zwischen den Steen Nummer 9 Trockenbeerenauslese, As the Kracher wines gain in intensity, so they diminish in alcohol. The overwhelming richness is held in check by life-giving freshness. The fruit flavors are just a part of the wine, because the botrytis and density are just as important. The finish of honey lingers long., 96.0, 103.0
Germany, , Starts off with aromas of struck flint, heating oil and even some sweaty-sock notes before delivering melon and apple flavors on the palate. Offers decent complexity, but lacks focus and length. Drink now., 84.0, 12.0
Germany, Herrenberg Eiswein, If you're seeking laser-like focus in your eiswein, this is the bottling for you. Although it starts off musky and feral, it's also ultracrisp and racy, with intense pineapple fruit surrounded by hints of wild meat and spice, then finishing with blazingly pure citrus., 93.0, 171.0
Argentina, Single Vineyard Gran Reserva, Saturated on the nose, this has aromas of pencil lead, coconut, vanilla and black fruit. It feels tannic, with pulsing acidity pushing raisin, prune, black plum, licorice and graphite flavors. The finish is oaky, resiny and chocolaty tasting., 89.0, 34.0
Spain, Cirsion, Jammy, creamy and superripe, with raspberry, burnt toast and coffee on the thick, meaty nose. Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine. It pushes the envelope on ripeness, but that's become the Cirsion way. An awesome wine that deserves a proper decanting., 96.0, 303.0
US, Olivet Lane, The pedigree of this rich Pinot Noir is evident right away in the mouthfeel, offering a silky and satiny texture, brightened with citrusy acidity. The flavors immediately kick in with a solid wall of red cherries, licorice, persimmons, pomegranates and cola. An exciting, complex wine to drink now, and it should gather momentum over six years, maybe even longer., 95.0, 62.0
Spain, Alenza Gran Reserva, This 10-year-old wine from a hot vintage is soft and plump but has gaps in its fiber. The mouth is tannic around the edges but lacks stuffing, while flavors of plum and berry run jammy and heavy. A hollow finish with prune flavors and dry tannins is the final act., 86.0, 103.0
France, Venus Brut Nature, No, not the goddess: Venus is the name of the horse that plows the Agrapart vineyards. This wine, labeled “nature”—without dosage—is all green apples and very dry. It's distinctive, but many would find it too distinctive because of its rather lean edge, and very acidic aftertaste., 88.0, 93.0
France, , A smooth wine that is ripe with rich berry and dark-plum fruits. With its soft tannins and juicy crisp acidity, the wine is warm, rounded and likely to develop quickly. Drink this already attractive smoky wine from 2020., 90.0, 40.0
Italy, Moscato dello Zucco, Strong sunshine and fertile soils give this wine an extra boost in intensity and overall mouthfeel. Golden honey, candied fruit and sweet almond paste flavors drive the experience., 92.0, 31.0
Argentina, Primeras Viñas, Aromas of cedary oak, vanilla and spiced berry fruits are encouraging. In the mouth, however, this old-vines Malbec is jumpy and rubbery, with high acidity. Flavors of stalky red plum taste mildly oxidized and Sherried, while the finish is herbal and tastes burnt. All in all, this just doesn't fully come together., 87.0, 53.0
US, Amber Ridge Vineyard, Sweet oak and upfront raspberry- and cherry-jam flavors mark this Pinot. It's not particularly complex, but it is delicious, and the brisk acidity make it shiny and clean in the mouth., 89.0, 44.0
France, La Demoiselle, From clay and flint soil, this Pinot Noir has delicious up-front ripe raspberry and red berry fruit flavors laced with nutmeg, a light layer of toast and bright acidity to finish., 89.0, 144.0
France, Cuvée Elisabeth Salmon Brut Rosé, This is a beautifully balanced, elegant and mature sparkler. There is fruit—ripe strawberry—but the main character is its fine balance and richness. It can age, though it is at its best now., 94.0, 222.0
France, Fonteny Premier Cru, This is concentrated, with big, firm tannins that are still covering the red berry fruits. It is always going to be firm and dry, although the aggressive tannins should open up to show more fruit after another two years., 90.0, 140.0
Italy, Camartina, Zesty and woody at first, but later balsamic notes blend with jammier aromas to create a solid but oak-influenced bouquet. The palate features berry and vanilla flavors while the finish is creamy and a touch chewy. Very nice, with no serious faults. But very expensive or what you get., 88.0, 104.0
Argentina, , Blueberry and cassis aromas are jammy and suggest graham crackers. This feels tight and narrow, with strict tannins. As for flavors, look for baked berry, herb and earth notes the finish shows berry,  leather and carob notes., 86.0, 13.0
US, Block One Champoux Vineyard, Fermented to a plus-size 15.4% alcohol, this rare wine from one of Washington's oldest and best Cabernet vineyards shows what a gifted winemaker can do with great fruit. The play of flavors, mixing red and purple fruits, toasted nuts, mocha, caramel, bark and earth, is exceptional. The detail is extraordinary for a wine with such high alcohol. The acids and tannins are seamless and fine, and the flavors extend into an unusual finish that suggests menthol and eucalyptus – not generally a character found in Champoux fruit. All in all it's a wonderful voyage, and one of a handful of essential Washington wines., 95.0, 72.0
Argentina, Celador, This herbal wine has grassy plum aromas and a touch of cowhide on the nose. Aggressive tannins and sharp acidity run alongside leafy plum and raspberry flavors. Chocolaty oak with vanilla sweetness helps things along., 84.0, 22.0
US, Coopersmith, This is a polished, pretty wine of great power. It displays a dazzling array of red and black cherry, raspberry, currant and licorice flavors, tinged with mocha and cedar. Has a certain young vine freshness. Mid-term cellaring for a couple years will help it knit together., 89.0, 54.0
France, Valmur Grand Cru, Fine ripe fruit shows on this full-flavored wine, but there is as much of the vanilla, toast and spice character as there is of the peach note. The texture, though, is all fruit, tight apple skins with final fresh acidity., 93.0, 81.0
Spain, Finca El Bosque, Not even El Bosque could escape the difficulties of the cool, extended 2007 vintage. While typically dark and bulky on the nose, it's also dull by Bosque standards, with oaky mocha and coffee stepping in as filler. The body is drawn and tannic, with oak, resin and dark berry flavors. Finishes resiny as well. By no means bad, but given Bosque's precedent it's not stellar., 87.0, 163.0
US, , Smells inert and dull, tastes soft and sugary sweet in cherry pie filling flavor. Production on this is 14,374., 82.0, 31.0
Argentina, Argentino, This blend from the Nicasia and Adrianna vineyards is the best Malbec on the market today. There's raisin, mineral, licorice, blackberry and more. The mouth is like a Mack truck on ice skates, meaning it's both huge and elegant. And the mile-long finish of coffee, mocha and molten black fruit is awesome. Drink now through 2013., 96.0, 123.0
US, Butterdragon Hill, This is an inaugural release, made by Napa veteran Cary Gott, grown on the western hillsides above Highway 29. It is 100% Cabernet, classic in its acid and tannin structure, with very ripe cherry compote and cassis flavors. However, it's too sweet for complete balance and enjoyment., 85.0, 72.0
US, Made With Organic Grapes, With organically grown grapes from both Lake County (58%) and Mendocino (42%), this showcases the best of both regions. It has a great mix of lemon, grapefruit, honeydew and kiwi freshness that remains balanced on the finish. It's a quaffable summer wine., 88.0, 14.0
France, , Firm and hard, this shows density rather than fruit, tannin rather than freshness. It goes for the dark side of Clos Vougeot. There is some bitterness from the extraction, but the wine needs many years before it comes into balance—the juicy red fruit finish promises richness later., 90.0, 240.0
Italy, , Tight menthol, currant berry, cedar wood and dusty mineral notes eventually waft off a wine that seems reluctant to open at first. The structure is solid without being hard, with espresso, leather and a powerful, dry finish. Imported by Vias Imports., 89.0, 64.0
France, Pur Sang, Boysenberry, blueberry and black cherry aromas lead on the nose of this wine, with a touch of warmth and chocolaty sensation following behind. The palate veers more towards red-fruit flavors, with a thin midpalate and an astringent close., 86.0, 23.0
France, La Doriane, This seems a tad more restrained than usual for La Doriane, which has typically been extremely lush and exotic in the past. The 2012 isn't as over the top, but still shows plenty of ripe apricot and tropical fruit framed by smoky oak and baking spices. The finish is long and mouthwatering, suggesting at least a few years of longevity., 94.0, 132.0
France, Clos des Mouches Premier Cru, Light in color, this rejoices in its perfumed character as much as its fruit. There is a heady smoky aroma, while the palate shows a leaner character. The fruit flavors of red berries are given an extra dimension by the smoky wood and the meaty edge., 91.0, 90.0
US, 30th Anniversary, I found the winery's regular '04 disappointing. This commemorative bottling is oakier and much riper in tropical fruit flavors, with non-malolactic crisp acidity and a buttercream texture. Somehow, though, it lacks the power and follow-through a great Chard should have, especially at this price., 87.0, 73.0
US, The Narrows Vineyard, This complex, sophisticated and undeniably delicious wine blends strong flavor components into a harmonious whole. Aromas are lightly smoky and toasty, while flavors emphasize black tea, Bing cherry and sweet vermouth. The texture is firm and fine-grained giving a very smooth mouthfeel, and the finish lingers nicely., 95.0, 82.0
France, Corton-Charlemagne, As always, Corton-Charlemagne offers an opulent Chardonnay. In this vintage, the wine has intense tropical fruits, very ripe although never losing sight of its acidity. There is terrific concentration here, giving a wine that is very rich., 95.0, 182.0
US, Estate Lemley Ranch Vineyard, A dark, dry, tannic and rustic wine, made from this old variety. Very full-bodied, with moo shu plum sauce, anise, black currant and cedar flavors. Like a blast from 100 years ago, the kind of vino rosso the pioneers used to make. Will last for many years., 88.0, 24.0
Germany, Schlossberg R  Erste Lage GG, Whiffs of blackberry, violet and molasses are intoxicating in this intensely ripe, rich Spätburgunder. The palate is a bit heavy in pulpy black-fruit flavors, but a stream of cranberry acidity and a musky floral note add levity and grace. It finishes briskly, with just a murmur of tannin., 88.0, 124.0
US, Vintage Brut, Just about half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir, with a touch of Pinot Meunier, this fruit-forward bubbly  tastes sweet, even by California sparkling wine standards. It's almost what the French call demi-sec, with sugared lemon mousse and raspberry-vanilla cream flavors., 84.0, 32.0
France, Clos de la Maréchale Premier Cru, Delicate, perfumed, with its fresh fruits dominant. They are light raspberry flavors with just a backbone of dry tannin. The whole is vibrant, fresh., 89.0, 74.0
Italy, , This Bolgheri Superiore shows luscious and clean notes of mature black fruit, plum, prune and loads of vibrant black cherry. Wood elements of spice, tobacco and leather are well integrated and the wine is impressively smooth and generous on the finish., 92.0, 41.0
France, , A complete wine. As it starts in the mouth, there is a feeling of everything in its place. The tannins are initially soft, dusty rather than dry; then the dark plums, red berries and so-sweet strawberries come into play. And finally, they all come together in a climax of richness and freshness., 98.0, 134.0
US, Topaz Impérial, Pale peach in color, this softly sparkling blend of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay smells sweetly of red apples and a hint of lanolin. There's a gentle sweetness upon entry that carries through the finish with a bright acidity and pleasant apple and pear notes., 86.0, 33.0
Spain, Reserva, Like it's bigger sibling El Anejón, this Reserva from a warm vintage is almost one-quarter Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in addition to Tinto Fino (Tempranillo). The opening of burnt earth, brandied cherry, rubber and herbal aromas is distinct. This feels a bit tough and chewy, with boysenberry, cassis, vanilla-cream and herbal spice flavors. A fairly smooth finish is young and vital. This should improve with aging. Best from 2019–2026., 93.0, 91.0
US, Riebli Valley Vineyard, Even by De Loach's standards of enormously ripe Zinfandels, this one stands out. It's a hydrogen bomb of a wine, fantastically rich in berries and fruits that have a slightly dried quality to them. The tannins are thick, and the alcohol seems higher and hotter than the stated 14.5% by volume., 88.0, 34.0
France, , This opulent, rich Clos de Vougeot could perhaps use firmer tannins, but it has ripe berry and cherry flavors. It has a solid core that is enveloped by the generous fruit. Age this for six years and more., 93.0, 191.0
US, Trata, You'll find it difficult to keep your hands off this gem, a block selection from the estate vineyard. The name, notes the winery, comes from an ancient Greek dance. Dark, smoky and toasty, this gripping wine is tight-knit and packed with raspberry and black cherry fruit, set against sweet baking spices. The balance is perfect, and this will drink well now through 2030., 94.0, 42.0
France, Champeaux Premier Cru, New wood aromas dominate this powerful wine, which shows how much time it needs to age. It also has concentrated, juicy black-cherry and plum flavors and lovely acidity. This wine is made from fruit sourced from a two-acre parcel in the Champeaux premier cru., 95.0, 92.0
France, , Normally one of the most elegant of Pauillacs, the 2003 is big and dense. These dark tannins mask delicious black fruit, flavors of spice and layers of acidity. This is going to develop relatively fast, despite the density of the wine, just because it is so rich. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates., 94.0, 142.0
Italy, , Luce della Vite opens with an opulent, generous style and is packed with black cherry, black currant, cola, leather and pipe tobacco. This is a plush, rich and deeply textured wine, with plenty of intensity and staying power. It shows dense tannins with a touch of youthful astringency. Age 10 more years., 97.0, 93.0
France, , With three acres out of 36 in this Grand Cru, Faiveley is one of the larger proprietors. The wine is firm and structured with solid tannins, while black fruits give acidity and freshness to this massive wine. Drink from 2020., 93.0, 391.0
Germany, Kiedrich Gräfenberg Beerenauslese, Sweet and viscous, this ratchets up the level of sugar and concentration beyond that of Weil's 2009 auslesen. Dried apricots rule, but nuances of musky spice and candied pineapple play supporting roles. Unctuous enough to pair with dessert if need be, but better on its own, or perhaps with aged hard cheeses., 95.0, 292.0
US, Precious Mountain Vineyard, A stupendous Pinot Noir, showing how beautifully this vineyard performs in the remote Sonoma Coast above Fort Ross. Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021., 99.0, 94.0
US, , A green, vegetal note marks the berry and cola flavors. It's a big, sturdy wine that's high in alcohol and slightly warm, with considerable tannins. It doesn't seem likely to improve with age., 84.0, 42.0
France, , This is already delicious, a wine that opens with the juiciest fruit, great wafts of perfumed raspberry juice followed by vivid acidity. The tannins are an adjunct to the wine, a light layer under the opulent Morey-Saint-Denis fruit. Drink in the next 3–4 years., 89.0, 194.0
Germany, Ürziger Würzgarten Auslese * * * Goldkap, Rich and sweet yet without excessive weight, Erbes' three-star auslese goldkap features beautifully delineated aromas and flavors of dried apricots, ripe peaches and pineapples as well as great minerality and freshness. The finish is virtually endless. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC., 96.0, 53.0
Italy, Cerequio Riserva, An exciting flagship wine from one of the best producers in Piedmont, this is dark, inky and penetrating. It offers beautifully intense aromas of cassis, dried forest berry, ginger, cola, leather, and cedar. On the palate, it shows an incredibly silky and long quality. Hold for 10–20 years., 95.0, 103.0
Germany, Graach Josephshöfer GG Trocken, Saffron and spice entice from nose to finish in this richly honeyed, yet dry Riesling. The palate is a delightful kaleidescope of fruit and mineral nuances anchored firmly by a stream of grapefruit and lime acidity. It's a complex, penetrating wine sure to improve through at least 2025., 94.0, 52.0
France, Les Terres Blanches, There is a good deal of wood here, the wine tasting of toasty wood as much as the fresh white fruits. It is just on the edge of too much wood, but then the crisp acidity and rounded flavors bring the wine back into balance. It really needs aging, 3–4 years., 89.0, 105.0
US, Fiddlestix Vineyard, If you're sensitive to high alcohol in Pinot Noir, this might not be for you. If you're not, you'll probably find the richness impressive. Although it's technically dry, it seems sweet and delicious like a raspberry tart that's sprinkled with cocoa and brown sugar, with a buttery, smoky crust. Ready to drink now., 88.0, 54.0
Portugal, 40-year old tawny, An old, mature wine, but one that has kept its ripeness and richness. The concentration is so intense that one glass is almost enough (except it tastes so good). There are walnuts, bitter chocolate and a delicious clean aftertaste. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc., 94.0, 152.0
US, Bismark Mountain Vineyard, This high altitude vineyard reliably produces enormously ripe fruit with correspondingly giant alcohol and tannin levels. The palate is full of chocolate-covered raisin and blackberry jam flavors, but it's a little over the top., 86.0, 53.0
Italy, Vigna Barbagalli, Made from 80- to 100-year-old vines, this compelling, earthy wine initially opens with funky aromas that burn off in the glass to reveal leather, tilled soil, blue flower and ripe berry. The palate delivers black and red cherry accented by white pepper, cinnamon and black pepper. With firm but velvety tannins, give this a few more years to let it fully  develop; drink 2016–2026., 93.0, 102.0
France, Les Cent-Vignes Premier Cru, Ripe and round, this shows softness and succulence. The wild strawberry flavors are rich and sweet, the tannins way under the generous fruit flavors. There is a fine, open juicy character as the wine finishes with light acidity., 92.0, 51.0
South Africa, , This zippy SB from Graham Beck starts with a nose of gooseberry and grass followed by lemon, minerals and tropical fruit. Clean and classy, it will pair well with spicy cuisine, grilled chicken, fish., 89.0, 15.0
New Zealand, , This vintage of what can be a stellar wine lacks weight and richness. Intense red-fruit flavors are tinged with compost-y mushroomy, fungal notes that come across earthy and bitter. Drink now., 84.0, 52.0
US, , This is a lush wine. It's 95% Cabernet, with a few drops of Cab Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Distinctly Californian in the softness of tannins and low acidity, it's ready to drink now. The waves of cassis and notes of licorice, cola and new oak impress with their richness. However, this is the leanest Rubicon in years, missing the qualities of greatness. Drink now. 5,244 cases produced., 89.0, 115.0
US, Bryce Vineyard, This riveting wine displays the exceptional finesse and precision that fruit from this AVA can deliver. It's Pinot Noir expressed in the most subtle and demanding way. Beautifully orchestrated red fruits, sappy acids, lush spices, perfect balance and an immaculate mineral-soaked finish are all on display. Drink 2018 through 2030., 96.0, 63.0
France, Turckheim Heimbourg, This is a starkly mineral wine, with straightforward apple aromas followed by a crisp, bright palate infused with notes of beer nuts. Finishes light and dry, with a final accent of lemon peel., 88.0, 64.0
US, WHITE4 Huerhuero, This is a good price for a wine of this easy charm. It has a soft, oily texture, with opulent flavors of tropical fruits, flowers, buttercream, honey and spices. There's something egg-noggy about it., 87.0, 14.0
US, , The flagship wine from Quilceda Creek offers exotic scents of plum, cassis, loam, coffee and pine sap, a rich and evocative blend. The wine delivers all that is promised and more; it is deep and dense with flavor, polished, focused and persistent. Vanilla, espresso, fine tannins, luscious acids and cascading fruits., 99.0, 125.0
France, Clavoillon Premier Cru, It's not so much the fruit but the richness and concentration that mark this wine. Yet it's not superripe because of the hot 2003 vintage. This wine, with its origins in biodynamically grown grapes, preserves a great purity of fruit as it layers intense almond and citrus flavors over vanilla and yellow fruit tastes. It should age well., 95.0, 113.0
France, , Firm and structured, this has strong tannins set over smoky fruit. It has concentration, although the wood flavor has an old-wood feel, seeming just a touch dirty., 86.0, 63.0
US, Ciel du Cheval Vineyard, The wine is built around flavors of crisp citrus, white peach and green apple fruits, wrapped in a pleasing minerality. It's all quite fresh and nicely textured. Just a bit of citrus rind enlivens the lengthy finish., 89.0, 25.0
France, Les Porets Saint-Georges Premier Cru, The 60% new wood aging is showing strongly in this structured wine. Rich and rounded, it offers hints of spice, red cherry fruits and a firmly, tannic edge. The aftertaste brings out a jammy richness. Drink from 2017., 91.0, 101.0
France, , Rich, concentrated wine, with generous fruits and soft tannins. It has super-ripe black plums, a touch of chocolate and spice from wood aging. Powerful, juicy, fruity, likely to age well over the medium-term, over the next 3–4 years., 89.0, 125.0
Spain, Parcela El Picón, This high-priced 2003 parcel-based Tempranillo hits with funky citrus peel and wet clay aromas, which are followed by cherry and savory, almost stewy berry flavors. The heat of 2003 is evidenced on the soft, hollow finish. It's a very good wine with character and typicity—but for $225?, 89.0, 225.0
New Zealand, Prima Donna, For Peg Bay's high-end bottling, this is a bit of a disappointment. It offers dried spices and cherries on the nose, then adds sour cherry flavors on the palate. With time, darker cherry flavors emerge, showing a slight element of sur-maturité. It's medium-bodied, with some firm tannins still in evidence. Hold through 2008 and hope for improvement. Imported by Meadowbank Estates., 88.0, 74.0
Spain, Viña Alarde Crianza, Simple but steady and composed. This is throwback-style Rioja crianza, meaning it's moderately oaked and not very fat or expressive. Strawberry and cherry flavors run the show, and the mouthfeel is fresh. More innocuous than detailed, which means it'll do fine by-the-glass., 85.0, 13.0
Italy, Sassicaia, One of Italy's most iconic bottlings, the 2012 Sassicaia is drop-dead gorgeous. A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc, it boasts sensations of blue flowers, cedar, juicy red currants, ripe raspberries, white pepper and a balsamic note. Structured, radiant and loaded with finesse, it delivers everything you'd expect from a world-class wine and more. Drink 2018–2032., 99.0, 235.0
Spain, Reserva, A little old school with its dill and vanilla aromas and flavors, but with leather, raisin and berry accents and a nice medium-deep body, it more than gets the job done. The palate features herbal plum and berry flavors, while the finish is a bit short on fruit and long on dill. Improves with airing; drink now. Imported by Freixenet USA., 87.0, 24.0
US, Wild Yeast, Buttery and yeasty, this soft and palate-pleasing Chardonnay shows plenty of nutmeg and other baking spices, along with pretty pear and apple flavors. It has a touch of mineral and a highlight of flower., 89.0, 35.0
Argentina, Finca Bella Vista, Electric purple in color, with a concentrated, deep nose of mineral, black plum and toast. The palate is lush and giant, but balanced perfectly by natural acidity and fine tannins. Huge berry and plum flavors are dense, and vanilla, coffee and herb flavors grace the long finish. Drink from 2010 through 2016., 93.0, 112.0
Chile, Kai, Warm, furry aromas of olive, prune and animal hide are challenging. In the mouth, this cool-year Carmenère feels tartaric and narrow, with grating tannins. Fiery flavors of black fruits, raisin and oak are mildly salty and herbal, while the finish feels hot and tastes of minty oak and black fruits., 89.0, 235.0
France, , Powerful and concentrated, this has an intense expression of ripe tropical fruits. The wood shows strongly at this stage, although with this amount of richness, it has the weight and the power to develop well over many years., 95.0, 123.0
US, Estate, Unusual for the Russian River, this 100% Cab is earthy and robust in chalky tannin accented by milk chocolate and juicy cassis. An edge of forest floor plays throughout, with the wine exhibiting more dry tannin on the finish., 88.0, 84.0
Germany, Hochheimer Kirchenstück Beerenauslese, Wet slate and chalk penetrate through silken layers of honey, fig and dried apricot in this decadent beerenauslese. It's intensely concentrated in fruit, but also racy and taut, finishing with a flair of rose petals and pink grapefruit. Stunning now, but structured enough to develop beautifully for decades., 95.0, 323.0
US, , The aroma is deep and inviting, equal parts new oak, Cabernet fruit and dried herbs. Has tremendous weight, with red and black cherry, cola, chocolate, cassis and roasted coconut flavors. Brilliant now, virtually flawless and totally delicious, yet has the impeccable balance to age and even improve over the years. The listed price is its pre-release price. Drink now through at least 2020., 99.0, 245.0
US, Precious Mountain Vineyard, In recent years, Precious Mountain Vineyard has provided Bob Cabral with some of his most glorious fruit. Tremendous in flash and depth, it offers compelling flavors of raspberry and cherry, accented by sweet, smoky oak. There's such complexity in the acid and tannin structure, and in the earthy, stony, spicy nuances, that you find something new to love with every sip. This masterpiece is fabulous now, and will develop bottle complexity over the next 15 years, at least., 98.0, 94.0
Argentina, Catena Alta, Impressive and saturated, with ripe aromas. The mouth is focused and, generally speaking, quite rewarding. The blackberry and dark plum flavors are big and aggressive. If there's any one place the wine doesn't wow, it's on the finish, which is short and a bit sharp-edged. Needs food. Imported by Billington Imports., 89.0, 45.0
US, Rockin' One, Soft and generous in fruity flavor, this has pronounced new oak that accents cherry, raspberry, smoky vanilla and peppery spice flavors. It's mainly Grenache, with a little Syrah, from the Templeton Gap area of Paso., 87.0, 34.0
New Zealand, , A pale, crisp, cranberryish rendering of Pinot Noir, this is the sort of light-bodied, red-fruited Pinot that could be served with salmon or other fish dishes., 85.0, 23.0
Australia, Quintet, One of Australia's most expensive and sought-after Cabernet blends, Mount Mary's Quintet has failed to impress more than one American critic. It's an appealing, well-crafted wine that combines leather, cherry and dried herbs in a somewhat lean, crisp style that delivers a long, mineral-and-cedar finish., 89.0, 145.0
US, Paragon, Soft and fruity, with easy flavors of blackberries, blueberries, oak, chocolate, anise and pepper. Pretty good for the price., 83.0, 12.0
France, Grande Cuvée Brut, This multivintage blend nails the essence of Krug, intense richness of fruit and flavor without weight. Meaty mushroom and soy aromas are balanced by rich red fruits, citrus, toast and mineral notes. Long finish. Imported by Clicquot Inc., 94.0, 172.0
Italy, I Poggiarelli, Oak tonneaux aging renders a rounder, softer and easier-to-drink Brunello. Beautiful layers of aromatic intensity include white mushroom, herbal notes, sweet cedar wood, tobacco, vanilla and cherry. Imported by Tutto Vino., 90.0, 50.0
Italy, Chiaramanti, Crushed violet, red berry, mint and menthol aromas lead the nose. The firm palate offers dried red cherry, raw strawberry, licorice, white pepper and sage alongside grippy tannins that leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unclench then enjoy before the remaining fruit fades., 88.0, 94.0
France, Grands Epenots, A firm, tannic wine that promises long aging. The dry tannins are driven by ripe black fruits and flavors of spice and pure acidity., 86.0, 83.0
US, Crow Ridge Vineyard, This is great Zinfandel. The vineyard was planted in 1915 and probably contains other varieties than Zinfandel. Yields are extraordinarily low, as they are in these coastal ancient vineyards. The wine's concentration is impressive, spanning ripe, crushed raspberries through cherry pie filling to black currants, with all sorts of earthy, minerally, balsam and cedar complexities, not to mention the masses of spice. Has the balance of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, with smooth tannins and fine acidity. Zinfandel hardly gets any better than this., 95.0, 33.0
US, Estate Bottled, Seems like it was picked earlier than most '03s, given the dry tannins and peppery, minty flavors. Still, it has a beautiful structure, classic and refined, with cherry and cocoa flavors and upscale oak. Drink now through 2010., 89.0, 55.0
US, Journey, Give this dynamic young Cabernet blend a good decanting or a little time in the cellar to mellow and let its edges round off. It's tannins are hard and astringent, masking the blackberries and black currants. Not one for the long haul, but 3–4 years should do the trick., 89.0, 155.0
US, Milbrandt Vineyards, A superb follow-up to the winery's 2003 Milbrandt, it's the same 40/60 blend from Clifton and Sundance, both located in Washington's new Wahluke Slope AVA. A penetrating nose of cherries, violets, blueberries and black olives leads into a wine that masks its power with finesse. Licorice, tar and smoke wrap around the bright raspberry fruit core, with just a whiff of white pepper. Great winemaking, and a price point more wineries should emulate., 93.0, 22.0
US, Cailloux Vineyard, The only one of the Cayuse Syrahs that is co-fermented with Viognier, this opens with a stunning, floral bouquet, showing extraordinary depth and texture. The wine has a floral top, a thickly fruity middle and a base with smoke, rock and meat. Still very young, it is already a complete, fully-realized, near-perfect wine with a finish that extends for many minutes. This should age for 25 –30 years. Right now, it's almost frozen in place; still a bit tannic, but with superb aging potential., 99.0, 65.0
US, Bucephalus, So insanely rich and ripe, it's practically a food group in itself. Floods the mouth with blackberry and cherry jam, cassis liqueur, milk chocolate and sweet oak flavors, in a texture that's soft and creamy. It's almost too much of a good thing, and would benefit from a little restraint., 90.0, 150.0
US, Spring Hill Vineyard, The flavors of cherry pie, sandalwood and spice are ripe and delicious, but this Pinot is a little off in the mouthfeel. It's jagged and rude. Decent, but ready to drink now., 85.0, 33.0
France, Le Château Kastelberg Grand Cru, Another wacky Riesling from Marc Kreydenweiss, this one somehow works. There's Asian spice here and an odd collection of oxidative aromas but also undeniable concentration and good length. Serve this unusual wine by itself or with Indian fare., 88.0, 105.0
US, Meredith Estate, A splendid, near-perfect Pinot, although it's very young and will benefit from time in the bottle. Few Pinots offer richer, more massive flavors. Just explodes on the palate with raspberries, cherries, persimmons, Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and cinnamon spices, yet the tannin-acid structure keeps it all balanced. A joy to drink as it warms and changes in the glass. Now–2014., 97.0, 54.0
Australia, The Coppermine Road, Everything about this wine is big, from the boisterous nose of cassis, herbs and tobacco, to the bold flavors of cassis, vanilla and tobacco. The finish is long and loud, like the volume's been turned way up. Ultimately, it lacks a bit of elegance and finesse; if that emerges with aging, this rating will seem conservative., 89.0, 65.0
Italy, Cerretalto, Cerretalto delivers aromas of natural complexity and oak-driven tones of cinnamon, clove, chocolate and exotic spice. The fruit is dark, dense and ripe. There's extra roundness and density in the mouth that holds together the wine's firm tannins and its crisp, acidic component. Hold 10–20 more years., 98.0, 215.0
US, En Chamberlin Vineyard, In a vintage that produced the finest overall lineup of Cayuse wines to date, it may seem a little nit-picky to score some higher and some lower. But the En Chamberlin deserves first place again. Brilliant aromatics of smoked meat, bacon fat and otherworldly roasted accents seduce instantly. Once on the palate, the silky, balanced, near-perfect mix of umami and fruit, plus licorice, cassis, coffee liqueur and black tea notes suggest it's as decadent as it is delicious., 99.0, 75.0
US, Fe Ciega Vineyard, Firm in acids, with some tannins, yet not at all hard. This is a magnificent, masculine Pinot Noir. It floods the palate with cherry pie, cola and mocha flavors, Asian spices and a sweet, smoky, buttery phyllo pastry quality. So technically perfect, with such structure, it seems guaranteed for the cellar. Drink now through 2010, but who knows how long it will last., 95.0, 43.0
Italy, Monprivato, Elegant and complex, this gorgeous wine is all about finesse, offering enticing aromas of rose petal, iris, perfumed berry, baking spices, anise and chopped aromatic herbs. The structured but silky palate seamlessly melds together juicy Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, clove, licorice and tobacco while bright acidity and ultrafine tannins provide the framework. It's already tempting and impeccably balanced but will be even better in a few years. Drink 2018–2030., 99.0, 175.0
US, Brosseau Vineyard, With brisk acidity and a tight, minerally feeling, this Pinot Noir is very dry, showing robust cherry flavors. It seems like an ager, but some raisiny overripeness might compromise it., 87.0, 54.0
Germany, Eiswein, Amber in color, this eiswein boasts a rich, caramelized palate full of sweet pastry, honey and baked-apple flavors. Hints of pollen and wax, along with a burst of intense orange-like acidity, add complexity to this intensely ripe, yet delicately textured wine., 90.0, 250.0
Argentina, Ultra, Stewy, muddled, herbal aromas come prior to a chunky, chewy palate. Flavors of compost, nutty berry fruits and turned earth lack freshness, while a stewed finish tastes mulchy and feels tannic., 83.0, 22.0
Australia, , This well priced wine offers typical Shiraz aromas and flavors, ranging from cherries to black olives and weaving in some smoky and tarry accents. It's medium-bodied, with a plump feel but also a firmly tannic backbone that would serve it well alongside steak, chops or burgers., 88.0, 15.0
Hungary, Mézes Mály Aszú 6 Puttonyos, Meaning “honey pot,” Mézes Mály is an esteemed south-facing, first-growth vineyard. This wine has an oxidized character resulting in nutty aromas and cheese-rind flavors. Still, this wine also showed flavors of dried apricot and raisin, although none of the namesake honey. Finishes long, but the oxidative note was still a strike against this wine. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd., 88.0, 115.0
France, Les Grandes Lolières, Les Grandes Lolières is a vineyard in the large Corton Grand Cru. This Pinot Noir shows a delicate balance between fine structure and beautiful red-fruit flavors. At the same time, it has weight and richness that lend this wine power as well as the chance to age for many years., 96.0, 104.0
Italy, Cannubi San Lorenzo, Elegant in style, spicy in flavor, with a suave texture that attests to deft handling at the winery. Plenty of coconut, earth and salumeria tones on the medium finish. Open and drinking well now but needs a flavorful accompinament such as duck., 89.0, 75.0
Spain, Malleolus de Sanchomartin, Talk about magnetic aromas of bacon, tobacco and bold black fruit, and then comes an oak-rich palate full of coconut, butter, chocolate and exotic berry flavor. Chocolate truffle and pastry work the finish, and overall this is a mile-deep beauty to drink from 2011 through 2017., 96.0, 204.0
Spain, Conde de Aldama Palo Cortado, This is more brown than burnished gold in color, while it smells of toffee, brandy and maple syrup. Salty caramel and peanut flavors finish like a peanut butter cookie bathed in salt. While this definitely works, it's not registering as the outstanding Sherry the price and packaging would suggest., 89.0, 175.0
Italy, , The complex aromas of rhubarb, coffee, black cherries, tar, anise, cedar and green tobacco evolve in the glass. Firm acids and tannins give this wine great structure; this should be a very long-lived Barbaresco despite its forward charms. From Ceretto. Cellar Selection., 91.0, 111.0
Italy, Paleo, Paleo (a pure expression of Cabernet Franc from Coastal Tuscany) is a drop dead gorgeous wine with amazing intensity and purity of aromas. You get it all here: Bright berry notes, drying mineral, exotic spice, cooling acidity and firm, satisfying structure. It's a rich, velvety and beautiful wine that will award you a memorable drinking experience now or in 10 years time., 98.0, 125.0
US, La Encantada Vineyard, This wine, even at the age of four-plus years, remains dry, tannic and acidic. It has modest raspberry and cherry jam fruit, but isn't going anywhere., 85.0, 43.0
Italy, Scrio, Scrio is a top-notch Syrah from Coastal Tuscany that does an excellent job of portraying not only the true nuances of the noble grape variety, but also the bounty of the beautiful territory that shaped it. Let this wine transport you to cypress-lined roads, stone farmhouses and Tuscan cuisine. The pleasure factor and richness are unbeatable., 98.0, 225.0
Australia, Astralis, The flagship of the Clarendon Hills line, this comes from a patch of 80-year-old vines that winemaker Bratasiuk claims routinely provides his best fruit. The 2004 is a stunner, yielding up scents of flowers and spice, framed by hints of vanillin oak. It's dense and amply textured in the mouth, packed with wonderfully expressive blackberry and blueberry fruit, then shows layers of rich tannins on the finish that leave no doubt this needs time in the cellar to show its best. This is a tour de force of Australian winemaking that should be consumed 2010–2025., 98.0, 325.0
Portugal, Toutalga, This is a ripe-fruited wine, rich with dried fruits, sweet tannins and a soft texture. With its weight and juicy character, this is ready to drink., 86.0, 4.0
France, Dom Pérignon Oenothèque Brut, A magnificent Champagne, one that is light, delicate, yet packed with character. It is beautifully balanced, with a bone-dry character, just softened by the toastiness that is developing. Expect this to age for many years., 99.0, 385.0
US, Estates Reserve, This wine represents the winemaker's choice of the best barrels from the two estate vineyards. It offers a full spectrum of fruits, from citrus to stone to light tropical, with a grapefruit note dominating. Round and fruity, it remains crisp and even a bit tart, despite the residual sugar., 93.0, 32.0
Australia, Founder's Block, Katnook's introductory tier of wines includes this dense, superripe Cabernet Sauvignon. Hints of smoke, spice and dried herbs on the nose give way to almost pruny fruit and deep chocolate flavors. Tannins are creamy-soft, making it approachable in its youth., 88.0, 25.0
US, District Collection, The alcohol is hefty but balanced, giving the wine a heat it wears well. The tannins are big and thick, while the fruit is all about ripe black cherries and chocolate. It hits the sweet spot, but finishes dry. Drink now–2018., 89.0, 85.0
Italy, Liste, Aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, leather, wild berry and a balsamic note take the lead. The palate offers juicy Morello cherry, black raspberry, licorice and sage alongside rather astringent tannins., 88.0, 125.0
US, Champoux Vineyard Red Wine, A unique version of Andrew Will's Champoux, this is more than half Cabernet Franc, with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot filling in the rest. Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk. All that said, the fruit more than holds its own against the terroir's minerality. Drink this with your best steak, and give it plenty of breathing time., 95.0, 53.0
Spain, Prestigio Pago de las Solanas, Hard to believe the price on this. Yes, it's a perfectly good aged Ribera, but special it isn't. Bricky and roasted on the nose, with spiced cherry and plum aromas. The palate is healthy and comfortable, with cola, cherry and licorice flavors. Vanilla and length define the finish. Too regular to recommend at $325., 88.0, 325.0
France, Marquis de Laguiche Premier Cru, Drouhin has the exclusivity on the Marquis de Laguiche domaine, which is producing great white wine. Here, minerality and citrus acidity are layered over beautifully judged wood. The wine is rich but crisp, white berries mingling with pears and a delicious finishing spice. Age for 5–6 years. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co., 96.0, 114.0
France, , Mineral and structured, this is a wine that is very linear and almost austere. There is elegance, fruit and wood along with a hint of ripe plums and peaches. But always that minerality, that steely character, which promise long aging., 95.0, 253.0
Italy, Galatrona, Galatrona is an opulent, gorgeous wine (from the excellent 2007) vintage that shows the very best of Merlot in Italy. Thanks to a unique growing climate located between Florence, Siena and Arezzo, as well as extremely low vineyard yields, the wine feels soft and velvety and imparts long-lasting flavors of black cherry, lively spice, tobacco and cigar box. The true beauty of Galatrona is that it shows all the passion and enthusiasm of its very talented winemaker., 98.0, 135.0
France, Clos Jebsal Séléction des Grains Nobles, Smoky aromas followed by the explosion of sweet fruits, with flavors of ripe oranges, of wild flower honey and acidity. This is gorgeous now, but its sweetness should be tamed with aging. A fantastic wine., 96.0, 214.0
France, , Taut and mineral, this is currently a wine that is waiting to reveal its power and majesty. The fruit is on a tight rein of acidity, which only slowly opens up to show mango, pineapple, crisp citrus, layers of toast and a mouth-enveloping richness. Age for at least five years, preferably 10., 97.0, 574.0
Spain, , The immediate impression is that this wine is heavy, ripe and oaky. Sawdust and wood grain are the lead aromas. In the mouth, this chunky Priorat is hard, with grating tannins. Hickory and toasted berry flavors finish hot and resiny., 89.0, 95.0
US, Ground Around, Blueberry liqueur and cigar box aromas greet the nose on this blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Grenache, which spent 42 months in barrel and one year in bottle. There are oaky tannins and a decent acidity that lingers long, surrounded by dark purple fruits, toasted coconut and a touch of vanilla., 88.0, 35.0
Italy, Bernardot, Ceretto's weakest Barbaresco in 1998 is still very good, with aromas of Asian spice, tea and roses that turn slightly grassy with airing. Licorice and earth flavors are accented by black cherries and strong breakfast tea. Firm acidity and tough tannins crack the whip on the finish., 87.0, 74.0
Italy, Nemus, Nemus pairs the light fruit and crisp acidity of Sangiovese against the hearty firmness of Cabernet Sauvignon to produce an informal, food-friendly wine that would match pasta dishes and pizza with fresh mozzarella., 86.0, 14.0
Italy, Asili, From one of the most esteemed vineyards in the denomination, this features aromas of oak, toast, black berry and a whiff of rubber. The palate offers plum, black cherry, roasted coffee bean, spearmint and vanilla alongside bracing tannins., 89.0, 195.0
US, Will Jarvis' Science Project, Made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, complemented with a small handful of Merlot, the wine is aged in new French oak half barrels. Tannic and savory in cassis and cranberry, the wine also shows a trace of black tea and tomato leaf. The wine's oak remains extremely pronounced, which suggests some time in cellar, through 2020., 88.0, 135.0
US, Bacigalupi Vineyard, Starts with a funky smell that doesn't go away despite lots of airing. Underneath that is a very dry, very tannic and deeply flavored Zinfandel, rich in berries, cola and spices. That barnyardy smell is troubling., 85.0, 53.0
US, The Will HVA Heaton, Simple and jammy, with tannicly hard flavors of blackberries and cola. Ready now., 83.0, 32.0
Italy, , You could get lost in the enticing fragrance of this wine thanks to wild berry, blue flower, baking spice, chopped herb and saddle leather aromas. The smooth, elegantly structured palate is just as inviting, doling out juicy black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and white pepper flavors. Polished tannins and fresh acidity lend balance and support. An impressive effort from this winery—one of Montalcino's little known gems., 95.0, 63.0
US, , This wine opens with a stemmy aromas and remains basic in the glass, with a sweet ending., 81.0, 11.0
Spain, La Nieta, Deep and dark as night, with a lake's worth of cassis and black fruit aromas. There is no interference here; just pure, big-boned, modern-style Tempranillo flavors of currants, blackberry and soft, cuddly oak. Finishes with cream and coconut, but length and power as well. Hold until late 2010 and drink through 2015., 95.0, 163.0
Italy, Montosoli, This is a wine that never won consensus despite multiple tastings. One panelist noted a strong dislike for a garlicky, skunky aroma that the others did not pick up. They lauded its herbal, wet clay, blueberry, cherry  and violet tones. Imported by Winebow., 89.0, 106.0
US, Ferguson Block, There's something old-fashioned but richly satisfying about this Pinot Noir. It's a bit heavy and quite ripe, with flavors of cherry preserves, black raspberry marmalade, cola, sweet heirloom tomatoes and new oak, wrapped into a sturdy mouthfeel. A bit soft, and ready now with a grilled steak., 88.0, 45.0
Canada, Journey of Hope Icewine, An unusual Merlot icewine, this is clear and quite lovely in the glass, with shades of sunset orange and mahogany, like burnished wood. It's unctuous and sugary in the mouth, with grainy flavors of sugarcane, strawberry jam and sweet cherry liqueur. Quite thick for an icewine, with a cloying finish., 88.0, 145.0
US, Lachini Vineyard, This is supersaturated, dense and decadent with sweet, jammy blackberry fruit. Powerful and intense, the ultraripe fruit seems to explode on the palate., 93.0, 42.0
France, , Bâtard-Montrachet is the largest of the white grand crus, yielding archetypal fat, open, generous white Burgundies. Louis Jadot's wine does not disappoint. It's a powerfully ripe, opulent wine that's generous and packed with delicious fruit balanced with a judicious touch of wood., 94.0, 203.0
France, Clos du Villy, With no discernable wood, this is all about tight, perfumed fruits. A stalky character comes from the light body and smoky character. At the end, the black fruits and acidity come into play. Drink now., 86.0, 24.0
Italy, Sperss, Sperss (the name is inspired by the local word for “nostalgia”) is a vineyard located in the Barolo territory of Serralunga. Angelo Gaja adds 6% Barbera to the wine for brightness and freshness but the overall ensemble shows so much more than that. It delivers sophisticated softness and a velvety texture that is backed by exotic spice and loads of wild berry and licorice. Add huge depth and intensity and you have the criteria for a cellar-worthy wine. Will be ready to drink after 2020., 98.0, 255.0
Italy, Parussi, Boasts knock-out aromas of flowers and herbs—a haunting perfume that adds cherry and balsamic notes as it develops. It's not a blockbuster on the palate, but relies on silkiness and finesse to make an impression, its long finish couched in supple tannins., 92.0, 81.0
US, , This is lovely Syrah, stripped of flash and barrel, showing pure fruit that has zip and true character. The acids really prop up the fruit, and nothing is hiding the natural spiciness of the grapes. It sets up quickly in the mouth, then sits and lingers gracefully, gently fading into a very clean, fruit-driven finish., 89.0, 16.0
US, , All the oaky, leesy richness is there, with buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky buttercream, and tons of fruity ripeness, with a blast of Meyer lemon, pineapple, white peach and apricot. Yet there's also a firm, steely minerality, and, despite the dryness, maybe even a delicious touch of botrytis. The acidity is mouthwatering., 96.0, 34.0
Italy, Sammarco, Potent and alive, kind of rubbery and leathery, with a shot of barnyard thrown in for good measure. Shows solid cherry and berry at the core, but that fruit is offset by hard tannins and overt firmness. Not a lush, modern playboy; more of classic with old-world appeal. Needs time in the glass to unravel., 89.0, 116.0
US, Soberanes Vineyard, Big, bold flavors of cherry pie, red currant, toasty oak and vanilla mark this ripe, tasty Pinot. It has broad appeal, successfully made for a palate that likes accessibile wines that seem sweet and fruity., 88.0, 55.0
Austria, Ried Schütt Smaragd, Yeasty funk initially plays over a whole mix of pink grapefruit, mandarin and lemon flavors. The citrus party continues on the palate, with zesty notes of citrus peel. Verve and freshness are kept only in slight check by a phenolic backbone and are driven on by the linear lemon freshness. While totally compelling now, the wine will become even more intriguing with bottle age. Drink 2015–2020., 95.0, 73.0
US, En Cerise Vineyard, Aromatic and invited, almost jet black in color, this single-vineyard offering is a pungent mix of blood orange, rosemary and cassis. Dense and focused, compact and layered, it is structured very much like a Cabernet, but with a full palette (and palate) of Syrah fruit flavors., 98.0, 65.0
Portugal, Barca Velha, This is the latest release of Portugal's most iconic wine. It's made only in selected years (the last vintage was 2000) from Ferreira's Quinta da Leda in the Douro Superior. This new vintage is superb. It's a richly tarry wine laden with dark plum fruits and tannins that are just beginning to mature. It's a ripe and luscious, demanding attention, yet will still age for many years. Drink now, or hold until 2020., 99.0, 426.0
Spain, Damana Crianza, A rewarding wine that isn't overly pricey or difficult to enjoy. Dark, lightly baked aromas hint at raisin and marshmallow, while the palate has a deep texture and vital acidity. Savory, tea-infused flavors bring pulse and kick, and as a whole it delivers a true reflection of what Ribera del Duero should be., 91.0, 21.0
US, , A bit thin on the blackberry fruit, and showing some veggie notes. Also pretty tannic. Might have seen its better days a year or so ago., 86.0, 34.0
US, , A big, rich, full-bodied wine that's kind of like Syrah, but with different flavors. There's a warm, baked pie filling taste of black and red cherries, currants, coconut macaroons, licorice, chocolate and violets, and the finish is very long and richly spicy. At its best now and for a couple more years., 89.0, 26.0
Germany, Hochheimer Kirchenstück Eiswein, Vanilla and crème brûlée aromas add complexity to intensely sweet orange-marmalade and apricot aromas and flavors. Focused, with good balancing acidity that leaves a clean citrusy finish., 89.0, 126.0
Australia, The Factor, Tarry and peppery, dark and meaty, it's difficult to describe how a wine that is so packed with lush blackberry and plum fruit can remain complex. The fruit completely fills the mouth, yet nuances of spicy, meaty complexity somehow permeate, building in intensity on the long finish. Supple enough to drink now, but should evolve positively through at least 2015 and last another 5–10 years beyond that., 97.0, 105.0
US, Ritchie Vineyard Cinder Cone, Lots of acidity gives the cherry and raspberry flavors a sour candy tartness that makes the mouth water. The mouthfeel is light and silky, as you want in a Pinot Noir. It's a fine wine to drink now, with a good decanting, but try cellaring it for 5–6 years to see what kinds of earthy, mushroomy complexities emerge., 88.0, 65.0
US, Las Hermanas Vineyard, An exotic Pinot Noir, feral and exciting in its appeal. Wildly complex, with the scents of a summertime walk through a coastal California woodland. Forest floor, mushroom, wild cherries and raspberries, roasted shank bone, licorice, sandalwood—the flavors go on and on, balanced with crisp acidity. So dry; a joy to experience., 96.0, 44.0
US, , Pretty much as good as Napa Cabernet gets. Shows the blackberries, black currants, blueberries and spicy plums of Oakville and scads of spices, and the tannin-acid structure is, in a word, superb. The oak elaboration is just about perfect, adding a tasteful layer of smoky, buttered toast. The finish goes on and on., 98.0, 75.0
US, , What a fabulous Merlot. Yes, it's dense in texture, like molten metal, with melted tannins, but it's kept lively with clean acids. Meanwhile, the flavors are sheer mountain fruit: concentrated blackberries and cherries and decadent mocha. Complex, elegant and addictively good., 93.0, 52.0
US, IX Estate Red Wine, From the winery's estate vineyard, high up on Pritchard Hill above the Silverado Trail, comes this spectacular Cab-based masterpiece. The color is purple-black, and massively saturated. Very intricate, complex, totally enjoyable, almost perfect. Like a great Pauillac, this monumental wine announces cassis, blackberry, cigar box, pencil lead, spice and cedar flavors that go on and on. Very tannic, but so beautiful, and amazingly rich. Decant if you're drinking now, or open anytime through 2020., 98.0, 175.0
Spain, Grand Reserva, Smoky like BBQ, with dried fruits, leather and heat. Maybe a bit too exuberant in how it hits the palate; the fruit is a touch tangy and clipped, while the tannins are persistent if anything. A touchy, prickly wine that will do well with grilled meats., 87.0, 105.0
Italy, Madonna del Piano Riserva, This beautiful riserva shows enormous thickness and blackness, like midnight of a new moon. The wine delivers impenetrable density, extraction, black fruit, spice, berry preserves, licorice, asphalt, ground black pepper, cherry liqueur and crème de cassis. There are seemingly no limits to the intensity and complexity here. The mouthfeel is dense, plush, firmly structured and very long. Keep this Brunello safely in your cellar 20 years or more., 98.0, 275.0
US, Estate Grown, A pleasant, complex and highly likeable Pinot Noir for drinking now. It's made in a lighter style, with a silky mouthfeel framing cherry and raspberry Lifesaver candy flavors. The acidity is especially nice, giving the wine a bracing feel., 89.0, 36.0
Argentina, Noemía, It doesn't take a great brain to figure out that this is a rocking, beautifully crafted international red wine. Mint, spice and chocolate aromas are dipped in lovely new oak, while the palate is all about bold plum backed by coffee and mocha. Stellar now and shows all signs of a wine that will only get better. Imported by Vias Imports., 93.0, 152.0
France, A360P Muenchberg Grand Cru, Utter generosity of both ripe and dried pear is immediately evident on the nose. Notions of sandalwood hover. The dry palate carries that same, generous fluidity at its deep core. There is immense concentration, shimmering with dried, fresh and cooked pear. But there also is a sense of earth, stone and fresh orange peel. The wine seems like a message from another world, , leading you beyond the physical, into a wold of contemplation. The finish lasts and lasts., 95.0, 83.0
US, Lenore, This wine offers green olive, tire rubber and sugared plum. It's elegant in style with lightly sweet blue fruit flavors., 84.0, 13.0
Italy, Solaia, Top-echelon, with a stunning purity and depth of layered fruit both sensuous and intellectually appealing. The dark cherry and plum core is oak-enveloped with rarely seen seamlessness, while the big but supple mouthfeel belies the wine's profound power and structure. A classic effort marked by perfect fruit-to-acid balance, firm, refined tannins and a seemingly endless finish. Editors' Choice., 97.0, 115.0
France, Les Lavières Premier Cru, A curiously earthy aroma announces a wine that is light, somewhat barnyard, the fruit behind the tannin. It has a juicy element leading to final cranberry acidity., 86.0, 44.0
Chile, Grial, Talk about sticker shock: $75 for a wine that used to be $30 or $40? Back to the wine, which has olive and carob aromas to go with forceful oak and creamy berry fruit. The palate runs heavy on the coffee and olive, and thus it takes time to find the berry fruit component lurking below. Classic Chilean Carmenère, but one of questionable value., 88.0, 75.0
Italy, Ornellaia, The 2008 Ornellaia delivers concentrated aromas of forest fruit, raspberry and black cherry. There are beautiful elements of soft spice and chocolate at the back and the wine ends with soft, plush tannins and smooth, berry-rich flavors., 97.0, 215.0
Italy, , Aromas of mocha, espresso, coconut, ripe black-skinned fruit and new wood lead the nose on this hearty blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 25% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. The thickly concentrated palate offers up dried black cherry, roasted coffee beans, toasted oak and vanilla alongside astringent tannins., 88.0, 175.0
Italy, Messorio, Round, ripe and opulent, this landmark Merlot offers lingering tones of ripe black fruit, tobacco and spice. Oak-driven aromas are still evident at this point, so give it another 10–15 years of cellaring. Lingering smoke and spice notes add to the long finish. Messorio is one of the most complete and complex Italian interpretations of Merlot., 97.0, 315.0
US, Estate, The second release of Figgins—a single wine produced by Leonetti's Chris Figgins—is astonishing. Tasted in a lineup of exceptional Walla Walla reds, it outshined them all. It's a sophisticated blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot, from the Figgins Vineyard, with gorgeous aromas of flowers, spices and black fruits. Seamless and long, complex and forceful without being overpowering, it can stand alongside top tier Bordeaux costing four or five times as much., 98.0, 85.0
US, , A best-of blend from several of the producer's vineyard sites, this wine explodes in flavor and complexity as though celebrating each site's individual beauty and potential. Black pepper and crisp orange and pomegranate flavors show through its layered and focused texture—a savory package with a seemingly endless finish., 96.0, 54.0
US, Wildcat Mountain Vineyard, Superripe in flavors of cherry pie filling and spice, this Pinot Noir is nice and dry. Brisk acidity accompanies the richness, balancing it and brightening the mouthfeel. It seems best now, so drink up., 89.0, 46.0
US, , Soft, full-bodied and stuffed with baked blackberry, cherry, raspberry and chocolate flavors, this big, rather hot wine has a bit of superripe sweetness in the finish. Yet it pulls it all off with aplomb and manages to stay balanced., 87.0, 15.0
Argentina, Nicolas Catena Zapata, Catena's signature wine is Cabernet Sauvignon-based, and it's a purple haze of dense, exotic aromas that lean toward lavender, flower petals and black fruit. It's saturated and fruity to the point of no return, with impeccable structure and mouthfeel. An avalanche of flavor and style. Drink now through 2015., 94.0, 123.0
France, Meursault-Blagny Premier Cru, The curse of Chanson's high toast for whites hits this wine. It is a shame, because once through the wood, the fruit is fresh and rounded, crispened but also given ripe white pear flavors., 87.0, 115.0
US, Hillside Select, The '05 Hillside Select is overwrought. It's certainly a big, ripe, softly juicy wine, rich and flavorful. Yet it offers little right now beyond jammy blackberries, cherries and chocolate and loads of sweet, smoky oak. Lacks subtlety and complexity in favor of sheer power., 87.0, 215.0
US, Smith Orchard Reserve, The high alcohol gives this wine glycerine-driven sweetness and Port-like heat. With its raisin and chocolate flavors, this is Mazzocco's signature style., 83.0, 52.0
US, , The winery makes a line of Cabernet Sauvignon from various AVAs of the Napa Valley, highlighting each on the label. From warmer Calistoga, this mouthCab is brambly black fruit-forward with layers of coffee and mocha., 88.0, 85.0
US, 30th Anniversary Cuvée Estate Vineyard, This is a Pinot Noir of considerable force. Your first impression is of irrepressible power, with masses of fruit punching through an overlay of tannin and oak. Then the flavors fantail out, suggesting cherries, cola, currants and spices that are rich and complex through the long finish. For all its richness, the wine retains an agreeable delicacy of texture. Comprised of lots selected by winemaker Bob Cabral for this anniversary bottling, it's right up there with Williams Selyem's best 2010 Pinots, and just as ageable. Drink now–2022. The wine is only available as part of a two-pack from the winery for $250; the other bottle is the 2010 Morning Dew Ranch Pinot Noir, from Anderson Valley., 97.0, 125.0
US, Backus, Price be damned, this is an authentically gorgeous, important Cabernet Sauvignon. It calls to mind the amazing 2001, with its huge, perfect tannins and acids and artistic appliqué of new oak. But the star of the show surely is the fruit. Mounds of ripe blackberries and cherries pile up, veering into currants and cassis and something wild and decadently animal, like charred meat. Fabulous now despite the firm tannins, and should evolve for many years., 97.0, 225.0
Italy, Oreno, A blockbuster wine with finely tuned renderings of coffee, tobacco, spice and leather, Oreno requires a rare steak cooked on a mesquite grill or something similarly big and bold. In the mouth, this Sangiovese-Merlot-Cabernet blend delivers loads of spice that leaves a lasting impression thanks its firm tannins. Drink after 2010., 95.0, 93.0
US, , A good, solid, slightly rustic Cab, with cassis and sage flavors that are wrapped into dry, slightly green tannins. Fine now, but doesn't have the stuffing for the long haul. Drink now–2010., 86.0, 54.0
Italy, Solaia, This stunning expression of Solaia opens with ample aromas of exotic spices, tilled soil, mature black-skinned fruit and an underlying whiff of fragrant blue flowers. The vibrant, elegantly structured palate doles out high-toned black cherry, ripe blackberry, white pepper, cinnamon, clove and Mediterranean herbs alongside a backbone of firm, polished tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2017–2032., 97.0, 325.0
US, , This companion wine to the famous Harlan Estate comes from the same Oakville vineyard. Decadent and vastly complex, it opens with cassis, grilled meat, cedar, spicebox, cigar box and cheddar aromas, and then turns medium- to full-bodied in the mouth. Terrific black cherry, blackberry and cassis fruit, pure and refined. Perfect elaboration of oak, char, tannins, acids and fruit, like a symphony orchestra working together. Drink now through 2015., 98.0, 95.0
US, Ascendance Cass Vineyard, Smoked beef, tart and tangy boysenberry jelly, black rocks and a cigar-box scent power the nose of this wine from an award-winning vineyard. The palate offers ample juicy tang along with chewy tannins, with dark chocolate, black cherry, and black olive enlivening the mouth., 89.0, 56.0
US, Family Reserve, The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crème de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years., 97.0, 625.0
Chile, , Even if this Cab shows eucalyptus on the nose along with asphalt and olive aromas, the bouquet is complex and true as far as high-end Chilean Cabs go. A saturated, syrupy body reflects a hot vintage, while baked flavors of earthy fruits, beef soup and chocolate qualify as stewy but tasty. A warm, flat finish says drink this Cabernet sooner rather than later., 90.0, 60.0
France, , Owned by the Cruse family, one of the Bordeaux wine aristocracy, this rich wine is dominated by Merlot, giving it ample weight. The 18 months of wood aging shows in the smoky edge to the wine, although this will soften. Drink from 2017., 87.0, 25.0
US, Moose Valley Vineyard, There's a beautiful wine in here, but it's buried under so much oak, it's hard to find. Vanilla, char, buttered toast and woody aromas and flavors dominate and contribute to the tannins. The underlying Cabernet seems quite lovely, and it's an elegant, refined wine for drinking now. You have to wonder, though, why they plastered it under so much new oak., 87.0, 125.0
Spain, Noble, This inky, concentrated bruiser opens with lemony oak, graphite, earth tones and deep black-fruit aromas. Like the nose, the palate is intense and ripe as Tinto Fino gets, with smooth, manageable tannins. Flavors of blackberry, prune, cassis, lemon rind and tobacco end with power, class and depth; drink from 2017–2027., 93.0, 162.0
Spain, Òlbia, Aromas of citrus, especially white grapefruit and lime, are spunky and sweaty like Sauvignon Blanc or Verdejo. A solid, fleshy palate is home to a mix of citric and tropical flavors, while the finish reverts back to grapefruit, with a monotone feel. This is Macabeo, Garnacha Blanca and Pedro Ximénez., 88.0, 95.0
Italy, Riserva, This opens with aromas of oak, toast, licorice, coconut and sugared plum. The taut palate offers dried cherry, star anise and a green note of powdered sage but not a lot of fruit richness. Raspy tannins leave a tongue-drying finish., 87.0, 325.0
US, Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard, This wine will divide aficionados. Some will find it too soft and fruity. Others will marvel at its sheer deliciousness. It's fantastically rich, a wine of deliriously decadent flavors, ranging from blackberry jam and crème de cassis to mocha, blueberry extract and buttered cinnamon toast. Yes, it's soft, but it's the softness of fine velvet. After all that richness, the finish is amazingly dry. Drink over the next few years to enjoy its youthful beauty., 97.0, 135.0
US, Garys' Vineyard, Shows the way this vineyard and appellation ripen Syrah so well. Just overpowers the palate with cassis, licorice, leather and dark unsweetened, slightly bitter baker's chocolate, with a potent dose of freshly crushed pepper. So impressive, the perfect expression of great terroir in a great, cool vintage. But it's very tannic. Drink now through 2013., 94.0, 33.0
France, Les Estournelles Saint-Jacques Premier Cru, This wine is dark and dense, very closed at this young stage. But wait for that rich fruit to burst out to give its intense acidity and ripeness to the wine. It's a powerhouse of flavors, spice and dark minerality. Drink from 2022., 94.0, 133.0
US, Melville, This tastes riper and hotter than the winery's other Pinots I tasted, almost to the point of raisins and stewed prunes. The vintage was very difficult, with stupendous heat waves that challenged both growers and vintners. The wine does its best, but can't quite overcome the ill effects of the heat., 86.0, 64.0
Italy, Runcot Riserva, Aromas of mature berry, espresso, exotic spice and a whiff of menthol emerge on this full-bodied red. The palate shows dried black cherry, coconut, licorice and roasted coffee bean alongside fine-grained tannins. This isn't a classic Nebbiolo but it's polished, balanced and will appeal to those who enjoy oak-driven sensations., 90.0, 160.0
US, Oak Savanna Vineyard, One of the better Sangioveses out there, because it avoids the pitfalls of unbalanced flavors and textures. It's a dry, crisply acidic wine that's ripe enough in cherries and cola to satisfy. Good job. The next step is to build in complexity., 87.0, 35.0
US, Bonny's Vineyard, This is a very dry, richly textured Cabernet, vast in blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors, with the smooth, complex tannins Oakville is known for. However, there's a noticeable sharpness to the mouthfeel that may never go away., 87.0, 135.0
Portugal, Quinta do Penedo, A big dense wine, as tough as the rocks that make up the Dão soil. Its fruit is certainly there, a welter of black berries and plums. But in this young wine, the tannins are still in charge. This is going to develop, opening up, becoming less mineral, over the next three years., 88.0, 6.0
US, Dancing Bear Ranch, The tannins are holding this Bordeaux blend back now, making it hard and astringent. Even so, the fruit is so powerful, it breaks through to impress. The black currant, cassis and plum jam flavors are complexed with notes of teriyaki beef jerky, cocoa and Asian spices. Could improve considerably in the bottle., 88.0, 106.0
Hungary, Solus, The Solus Merlot is unabashedly ambitious, with upfront vanilla from toasty new oak, a high level of extraction and a dense, black core of ripe fruit. It's full bodied, with steely tannins and a long finish of fig and char. Try with a pan-seared steak., 89.0, 76.0
Spain, José Pariente - Fermentado en Barrica, This is truly a unique wine in the sense that hardly any Verdejos are fermented in oak. Not only that, the end result is stellar. There's soft buttercup aromas leading into a layered, vanilla-edged palate of spiced apple, melon and greens. The wine is round, substantive and it stirs interest. And for that we're grateful. Drink now through 2008., 91.0, 31.0
France, , This is an immensely dense wine that is going to be a classic. The dark tannins are still lined with wood aging but that will go because the fruit underneath is also just as dense and intense. Blackberry, black plum and damson plum give power and sweetness. This is a great wine with huge potential. Drink from 2028., 97.0, 145.0
Germany, Deidesheimer Hohenmorgen Trockenbeerenauslese - 375 ml, Exceeds even this producer's stunning beerenauslese, featuring an even more intoxicating perfume of honey, dried apricots and candied pineapple, with slightly more acidity to provide balance to the extra level of sweetness, so much so that this wine comes across as refreshing on the finish, despite the incredibly high levels of sugar. Drink now–2050, possibly longer., 97.0, 245.0
France, , This is a splendid wine. Yes, it is more powerful than the usual aristocratic Lafites,  but it still manages to retain a special air of great elegance and presence. The fruits are black, the tannins immensely powerful, the flavors are of black figs, dates, cocoa. At the end, there is a vibrant acidity that shows through, which promises a great life for this great wine. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates., 97.0, 345.0
Spain, Dionisio Ruiz Ijalba, Big and heavy, with forceful aromas of shoe polish, tar and balsam wood. It's saturated and dense in the mouth, but the cherry and blackberry flavors are tart and underdeveloped. And the finish falls off fast. Imported by Baron Francois Ltd., 84.0, 33.0
Germany, Trockenbeerenauslese, Even in a flight of top BAs and TBAs, this one stood out. It's hugely sweet and viscous, yet also has amazingly fresh acids that really prolong the finish and promise decades—if not centuries—of cellaring. Golden raisin and dried apricot notes are true to type, and the wine's balance is impeccable., 97.0, 445.0
Spain, Figuero Noble, Figuero's top wine is more than fine. The nose begins with meaty, leathery notes and backs them up with spice and ripe fruit. The palate is not flabby or fat; instead it's racy and features good acidity that pushes raspberry, tea, tobacco and nutmeg flavors. A more agile wine than many from this famed region. Should age well for five to ten years., 91.0, 131.0
Argentina, , Clean as anyone should reasonably expect given the almost unheard-of price. It offers solid cherry and blackberry flavors, while the mouthfeel is round and totally inoffensive. Drink it now; cook with it; make a sangria with it. Just enjoy it., 85.0, 4.0
France, La Moussière, A tight wine, with bitter cherry flavors and a lightness that gives easy, fresh drinking. The year, 2007, doesn't lend itself to a rich red Sancerre, but this brings out the freshness of the year well., 86.0, 74.0
US, Block One, Rich and loaded with exceptional fruit power, this is dominated by the Champoux Vineyard's classic black-cherry character. Accents of clean earth, violet, tar and caramel show extraordinary depth, framed by firm and muscular tannins., 93.0, 72.0
France, Clos des Cortons, Although this is dominated at this young stage by wood, you can get through the firm, spicy character to the dark, heady fruit flavors. It has concealed power and intensity of ripe, elegant fruit. It needs at least 10 years to mature., 92.0, 102.0
France, , A grassy, herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc-dominated wine, this has fresh grapefruit and lime flavors, with an orange zest and mineral edge. This is delicious and ready to drink now., 88.0, 16.0
Australia, Whalebone Vineyard, This firmly built Merlot shows almost Cabernet-like reserve in its tobacco, cherry and cassis shadings that finish woody, warm and firm. At the moment, the copious oak sits atop the fruit, suggesting at least another 2–3 of cellaring prior to full enjoyment., 89.0, 86.0
US, Private Reserve, This is a big, rich, flashy Cab. It's very ripe, brimming with jammy blackberry, currant, chocolate-covered raisin and spicy olive flavors. Drinks soft and opulent in instant appeal, but doesn't seem like a longterm ager. Best now through 2010., 88.0, 116.0
France, , A slight disappointment, but still very good, with honey, smoke, caramel and peaches. It's a bit over-the-top from a house known for restraint, but the superripe fruit is backed by some dry minerality. Bold and weighty, but not that long. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co., 88.0, 216.0
France, Cuvée Paradis Brut, A ripe, dry wine with delicious mature fruit, touched by wood from barrel fermentation. Grapefruit, almonds, some yeastiness all give complexity, as does the acidity that follows this intense wine right through to the finish., 94.0, 143.0
US, Père de Famille, The fragrance is almost otherworldly; sweet, dense and lightly lifted. This is a sinewy wine, that begins with compact power and focused, tart red fruits—predominantly raspberry and currant. At first juicy and tart, with hours of breathing time the wine broadens out into a wider spectrum of Cabernet fruits; cassis, blackberry and black cherry., 97.0, 55.0
France, Marquis de Laguiche Morgeot Premier Cru , The vineyards of the Marquis de Laguiche date back to before the French Revolution, and Drouhin is fully responsible for producing the wines since the 1940s. This ripe, opulent selection lives up to its illustrious pedigree. It is full bodied, and it offers vibrant acidity and minerality. It's a wine for aging over eight years and many more., 95.0, 114.0
Spain, Aurus, Miguel Angel de Gregorio makes wines that match his exuberant personality, and Aurus, with 85% old-vine Tempranillo and 15% Graciano, is his premier offering. The 2001's exotic nose pumps licorice, clove, nutmeg and vanilla on top of the ripest black-fruit aromas going. With pillowy tannins, unmatched breadth and huge flavors of blackberry, plum and chocolate, there's no denying this wine's quality and stature., 96.0, 184.0
Spain, Alabaster, If you like heavyweight Tempranillo, this is a textbook rendition. It's deep and dark, with earth, leather and oak in addition to monster black fruit on the nose. Feels lush, powerful and layered, with bursting blackberry, spice, mocha and vanilla flavors. Quite black and spicy on the finish. Drink from 2012 through 2016., 94.0, 243.0
US, Wine Creek Ranch, Nice and lush, one of the easier Grenaches on the market. It's soft and silky, with ripe flavors of cherries, mocha and spices. A touch (10% new) of oak adds just the right touch of smoke., 88.0, 26.0
US, La Colina Vineyard, Pretty raspberry fruit scents and flavors dominate, and in the mouth there is a sense of grainy sugars. It has good fruit and ripeness, but still seems a little disjointed. Perhaps more time in the bottle will help sort it out., 87.0, 55.0
France, , With light fruits and a dry texture, this mature wine is very ready to drink. It is light in texture and the bitter chocolate tannins are just starting to dominate. Drink now., 86.0, 84.0
France, Initiales, A fresh wine, all berry flavors and ripe juiciness. It's a wine to be drunk young, just touched by tannins. Delicious and fruity., 85.0, 14.0
Italy, Menfri, This vintage of Menfri (a “super Sicilian” blend of Nero d'Avola, Tannat and Cabernet Sauvignon) seems to have suffered from summer heat. The wine tastes jammy and sweet with aromas of prunes, plums and raisins., 84.0, 43.0
US, Abbott Claim Vineyard, From first sniff this exquisite wine grabs you and won't let go. Brambly berries, redolent with rich umami notes of spice and pine needle cascade into a wine densely packed with fruit and herbs. It lingers, opens and becomes more and more expressive, with soil-generated flavors of forest floor., 97.0, 65.0
US, Grignolino, Heitz has made this stellar rosé from the rare Grignolino grape since 1961. Ruby grapefruit-red, it's sultry with strawberry, watermelon, orange zest and salty spice flavor, highlighted with vibrant floral aromas., 95.0, 24.0
Spain, Monte Oton, On the spot and sweet, with black cherry and roundness on the nose. Plays above its price league via ripe plum and berry flavors, bounce, body and build. Whole, concentrated and shows good structure, depth and character. About as good as inexpensive Garnacha gets., 89.0, 7.0
Italy, Vigna del Lago, Charred earth, leafy underbrush, prune marinated in spirits and grilled herbs come together in the glass. The warm, evolved palate shows blackberry jam, dried cherry, licorice and the heat of evident alcohol alongside bracing tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to soften then drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit., 89.0, 107.0
US, DIst 83, This Rhône blend is scented with sharp-toned berry, spice, and menthol and it has an herbaceous note that is well-integrated and set against light tannins. Don't look for a lot of sweet fruit; this is more European, herbal and firm. A fine food wine., 88.0, 36.0
Spain, Amancio, Only a select portion of a prized 30-year-old vineyard gives fruit to the wine named after the Eguren brothers' great grandfather. It's rich, ripe and impeccably balanced, with a brilliant dark-purple tint and an avalanche of finishing toast, chocolate and tannin. Hold until 2009. 330 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc., 94.0, 153.0
US, Renelle's Block Reserve, This is the winery's “mother block,” the oldest planting that dates back to 1999. Bright and spicy—perhaps a shade too bright—it hints at volatility. Raspberry and cherry fruit are matched with balanced tannins and a soft suggestion of clean earth., 87.0, 65.0
Italy, Suolo, Made solely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of roasted coffee beans, toasted oak and blackberry jam. The warm, jammy palate offers black cherry extract, licorice, clove and black pepper alongside massively stringent tannins that leave the palate feeling roughed up and dry., 87.0, 165.0
US, Estate, From a St. Helena vineyard on the Silverado Trail, a ripe, somewhat rustic Cab that's powerful in cassis and chocolate flavors. It's a bit soft. Might pull together in a year or two., 86.0, 94.0
US, Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard, Always one of Williams Selyem's top Pinot Noirs, the 2007 is a spectacular wine. The vines are the closest to the river in the famed Rochioli vineyard, and the resulting wine always has an elegant structure and fruity accessibility that make it drinkable at a younger age. Showing rich flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, bacon, anise, Asian spices and smoky oak, it will develop beautifully over the next decade., 97.0, 75.0
US, Red Rock Terrace, The most complete and compelling of Diamond Creek's trio of '02s, combining the opulent accessibility of Gravelly Meadow with the power and authority of Volcanic Hill. The aromas of cassis, red currants, cedar, tobacco and cigar box lead to massively packed Cabernet flavors wrapped in huge, dusty tannins. The wine is so balanced, so distinguished and complete. Decant now if you must drink it, but it should start to mellow by 2008, and then peak and hold through 2015 at least., 97.0, 175.0
France, , Ripe and full-bodied, this immense wine has rich layers of tropical fruits. The wine, like so often in Corton-Charlemagne, is a powerful, huge expression of Chardonnay. It does have balance from acidity. Drink from 2018., 93.0, 282.0
France, Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill Brut, Even at 10 years, this is still just setting out. While it doesn't have the immensity of the 1996, it has a great intense grapefruit, pear and fresh apricot series of flavors that come through with toast, ripeness and a suggestion of almonds. 7–8 years aging., 97.0, 275.0
US, Pinnacle, A medium-bodied Bordeaux blend with sweet aromas of cherry pie and a hint of fresh sage and tarragon. Simple and straightforward with a ripe, red cherry palate, it's a touch soft with a slight green undertone, but there's nice bright acidity and soft tannins that carry through the finish., 85.0, 24.0
South Africa, , There's a great freshness to this Chenin, with upfront, juicy notes of clementine, Granny Smith apples and green melon rinds. The light and refreshing palate transitions into a bright, mouthwatering finish, with accents of pineapple-flavored acidity., 89.0, 17.0
France, Clos de Mazeray, This wine is ripe with yellow fruits and rich pears. It has a rounded character, with a creamy texture shot through with acidity. The aftertaste has touches of grapefruit and a minerality that gives good texture. Drink from 2018., 89.0, 117.0
Austria, Nummer 11 Trockenbeerenauslese, This opulent wine glides on the palate with richness combined with wonderful acidity. It is the intense freshness and sweetness that shows most strongly along with the super-rich, full texture. This is a superb wine for long aging, drink from 2018., 96.0, 105.0
Italy, Villa dei Misteri, This curiosity comes from a single hectare of land planted within the ruins of Pompeii. Plum and black cherry notes mingle with mineral, finishing with firm, dusty tannins. Elegant in the Mastroberardino style. In this, the second vintage of this wine, a blend of Piedirosso (90%) with Sciascinoso (10%), only 200 cases were produced., 89.0, 217.0
Italy, Rosé, Redolent of cran-raspberry, peach, pink grapefruit and yeast, or fresh baked bread and butter. The acidity is fresh and crisp with medium to long persistency on the finish. Try is with finger food appetizers., 88.0, 46.0
Argentina, Finca Altamira, One of the most untouched, terroir-driven Malbecs made in Argentina is Achaval-Ferrer's Altamira. It's harvested about three weeks earlier than most high-end fruit, resulting in core raspberry flavors and a certain redness of character. The wine is unfined and cloudy but still very clear on the palate, with length, power and class. Best from 2009–2012., 92.0, 112.0
Germany, Ürziger Würzgarten Spätlese, This intensely fruity, floral nectar hits the palate with electric force, catapulting vibrant acidity against sweet, tangy flavors of tangerine, peach and honey. A favorite amidst an excellent showing of 2014 Mosel spätlese, it's delicious now, but should continue to evolve well through at least 2020., 95.0, 34.0
France, Les Ruelles Premier Cru, While there is plenty of berry fruit and spice here, there is an awkward petrol character that also shows itself in the shoe polish aromas. If this can blow off, then this is a wine with potential richness. Since it is only just bottled, time will tell. But be cautious. Two bottles tasted. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd., 84.0, 53.0
Chile, Grial, Herbal, green aromas suggest bell pepper and salad. This feels jagged, with zesty acidity and hard tannins. Flavors of herbal berry are pushed by racy acids, while the finish offers tobacco, green notes and a healthy-feeling fade., 87.0, 75.0
Spain, Malleolus de Valderramiro, Serious wine for serious Ribera lovers, even if it's from a generally weak vintage. Smells of bacon grease, graphite and dark berry fruits. Feels tight and youthfully tannic, with hickory, smoked meat, clove, toast and blackberry flavors. Clove and spice rest heavily on the woody finish; needs time to evolve and absorb its oak treatment. Best from 2013–2018., 92.0, 212.0
US, Precious Mountain Vineyard, This is among the lightest in color of Williams Selyem's ‘05 Pinots, and also the most delicate in texture. But yields were very low, and the wine has a fantastically concentrated taste of wild raspberries, as well as crisp, stimulating acidity. Despite the elegance, it's enormously complex, with tiers of oak-influenced cola, herb tea, pomegranate, vanilla and Asian spice flavors. Gorgeous now, this very great Pinot should develop well in the bottle over the next decade., 97.0, 85.0
France, Clot de l'Amandier La Clape, If you need convincing of the true potential of the La Clape region of Languedoc, look no futher. This is a delicate yet complex wine of true character and depth with a beautiful bouquet of rich dark fruit, tea leaves, leather and menthol. The mouth, smooth and lush, is loaded with intense plum, cherry, spice and pepper. The balance is fantastic, making this an easy wine to enjoy now or an excellent candidate to hold for 3–5 years., 94.0, 63.0
Germany, , For such a diminutive price, this blossomy off-dry Riesling is not shabby at all. Refreshing on the palate with brisk lemon-lime acidity, it's straightforward yet satisfying with lingering white peach and honey flavors., 86.0, 5.0
France, Cuvée des Enchanteleurs Brut, With all the extreme intensity of this vintage, this wine brings even more. The start of cookie yeast and toast character, a vibrant mineral texture, hints of spice, green herbs and a final white peach flavor. It is still young, just keep aging., 97.0, 185.0
US, Rae's, Another elegant wine from Cambria. This one has a vanilla, smoke and grapefruit nose. Medium-weight, it is crisp in the mouth, though somewhat leaner than the Bench Break. This cuvée nicely melds green apple fruit with menthol and vanilla accents. The bouquet is a reprise of the long, sweet-tart, butterscotch and tangy oak finish., 91.0, 41.0
France, , A mix of fresh citrus and toasty wood work well together in this elegant wine. The texture is soft, rounded, finishing with a great dash of lime. This is sophisticated white Burgundy., 88.0, 56.0
Italy, Occhio di Pernice, This sweet wine from Italy is guaranteed to blow your socks off. Its thickness and density resembles concentrated maple syrup or molasses. It is made with Prugnolo Gentile (Sangiovese) grapes that are air-dried and then aged in small wood containers for many careful years. The gorgeous aromas include roasted chestnuts, brown sugar, prunes and sweet figs and you can sense the power too., 99.0, 237.0
US, , Still young, chewy and textural, this stands as a classic Washington 2005 red—lusciously laden with mixed red and black berries, generous and deep; dense and jammy. The mixed berries, red licorice, cherries, layers of butterscotch, toffee and caramel are beautifully integrated and linger seductively into the finish. It has some initial alcoholic heat, but the flavors compensate and go on and on. This is a wine that must be cellared another five or more years before it even begins to pull itself together. If you must pop the cork before then, decant it for at least six hours and more if possible before drinking., 96.0, 115.0
US, Barrel Select, Brisk and lean with a crisp red currant and plum profile, this dry, medium-bodied Cab is pleasantly structured with sturdy tannins and a fresh, herbal midpalate. A bit lacking in intensity and depth, and the finish fades out quickly, but on a sweet vanilla-kissed note., 85.0, 34.0
France, , Initially, this is a richly ripe wine with tropical fruit flavors. It also has an immense sense of structure that supports the fruit impressively. It's dense, concentrated, exuding power and solidity, while always keeping a sense of elegance. Drink from 2018., 96.0, 315.0
Chile, Gê, One of Chile's best wines is excellent in 2007. The bouquet is concentrated, jammy and powerful, with Graham cracker sweetness offset by earth notes and leather. Lush and deep across the palate, with classy cassis, blackberry and fudge flavors. Layered and silky on the finish. Drink now through 2014., 93.0, 92.0
US, Red Shoulder Ranch, A pear, apple-orange and earth bouquet sets the stage for a palate chockful of pineapple, pear and lemon flavor. Toast notes offset and vibrant acidity uplifts the fruit nicely. The finish is long and tart-sweet with complex leesy, earthy notes. Medium-bodied and restrained, this complex wine shows depth. Give it six months to a year to unfold., 89.0, 37.0
Portugal, Colheita Tawny, This is an astonishing wine for its age. It shines with fruit and with rich toffee flavors that are balanced by acidity. It's a warm, ripe wine, intense and concentrated. The dryness of such a long wood aging (the wine was only bottled in 2015) is really only a background to the richness., 96.0, 415.0
US, , Good enough to be a reserve, this includes just 4% Merlot and the rest is all Cabernet. Smooth and supple, with lovely toasty aromatics, it layers rich cherry fruit against the lush barrel spices. A companionable wine, already drinking beautifully, but perfectly fine to cellar for up to a decade., 95.0, 44.0
Portugal, Vintage, Powerful and dense, this wine exudes the darkest of tannins as well as intense black fruit. Layers of richness and structure show in this Port's considerable ageability, while its acidity lends freshness. This is a wine that should be aged for 15 years or more., 97.0, 95.0
US, , With a beautiful purple color, this wine quickly exhibits classic Cabernet aromas of black currants and cedar. In the mouth, it's full bodied and concentrated, showing powerful, sweet blackberry fruit. It's incredibly refined, impressively structured, massive, impeccable and frankly delicious. This should develop over the next 20 years, at least., 97.0, 195.0
US, H3, This Horse Heaven Hills Merlot has a powerful clove flavor running right up the middle; along with it come streaks of vanilla and tobacco. What elevates it above cheaper wines with similar flavors is the structure and the penetration of the fruit, which has the vivid berry character of the region. The tannins are quite astringent., 86.0, 15.0
US, Hyde Vineyard Belle Cousine, Almost equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon (with slightly more Merlot), this is a reduced and approachable wine. It's slightly syrupy-thick on the palate, juicy in clove, plum and blueberry. A trace of minerality fights for attention around a medium body, finishing fairly quick., 88.0, 66.0
Hungary, Essencia, This famed Hungarian dessert wine never disappoints. An elegant nose of honey, apricot, butterscotch and spice is followed by a luxuriant, mouth-coating wave of satiny honey and apricot flavors, balanced by citrusy acidity. Complex, perfectly poised, it's a wine with both pedigree and charm—delicious when sipped alone or paired with a mild Roquefort or fruit., 95.0, 544.0
US, Estate Bottled, A fantastic Cabernet that stuns now for authenticity and power, and should develop for many years. Despite the large production, lower than that of many first growth Bordeaux, the wine, which has tiny amounts of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, shows classic Oakville elegance and precision. Rich in black currants, blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate, it should hit its stride from 2011 through 2017., 96.0, 125.0
France, Vorbourg Grand Cru, Stately and developed, with caramel aromas that fold in to a luxurious texture punctuated with notes of apple, pear and persimmon. Long, flavorful finish. Drink now., 89.0, 47.0
US, , Ripe and sweet in cherry, chocolate and oak flavors, this Cabernet scores high in sheer deliciousness. It's a bit simple in structure, though, and unlikely to age, so drink up., 87.0, 95.0
Australia, RunRig, Winemaker Dave Powell is no longer with Torbreck, but the 2007 RunRig is one of his finest efforts. The complexity is almost overwhelming, as the aromas range from peppery spice and roasted meat to blueberry and tappanade. It's mouth filling and expansive, yet retains fine acids and just the right amount of slightly dusty tannins on the long finish. Approachable now, but capable of lasting at least though 2020., 96.0, 225.0
US, , This wonderful wine showcases the blender's art. The grapes come from 11 appellations throughout the valley, and the wine, while notable for its delicious flavors, also is great in structure. It has soft tannins and refreshing acidity, and is entirely dry, with moderate alcohol. Those flavors include raspberry jam, cherry-vanilla cream, cinnamon and white pepper. So easy to like., 92.0, 22.0
France, Les Pucelles Premier Cru, A rich, mouthfilling,  sophisticated wine. The secret is in the balance, with the concentrated fruit flavors—dried apricot, mango and lemon—in just the right proportion. It tastes delicious now, but will certainly age over five years or more., 94.0, 273.0
France, Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru, Despite its power, this is so elegant, showing tannins, minerality and generous flavors of black fruits, dark chocolate and spices. The smooth and rich surface belies the inner taut texture, showing how the wine will need many years to finally come round., 96.0, 525.0
Germany, Casteller Schlossberg Trocken GG, Whiffs of smoke and grain lend a savory bent to lemon and herb aromas on this full bodied, dry Riesling. Searing lemon-lime acidity and a minerally palate contribute to its lean, linear style., 88.0, 76.0
Germany, Rosalack Auslese, Now that this famous estate is turning out stellar wines once again, the only problem remaining is the pricing. This auslese features slaty, minerally aromas touched with hints of honey and quince, then opens up on the palate to reveal honey, pear, melon and even a hint of peach, all undergirded by a bedrock of minerality. It's sweet but balanced, with a crystal-clean finish and plenty of length., 92.0, 122.0
US, Georganne, This is a brand-new bottling from Merry Edwards. It's her first from Westside Road, which is warmer than her haunting grounds around the southern part of the valley. It's quite a promising debut. The wine is round, soft, charming and complex, with elaborate cherry, blackberry, licorice and cola flavors. It feels important and ageworthy. Drink now, with several hours of decanting, or cellar through 2020., 95.0, 54.0
Australia, Calliope Rare, Just a tiny serving of this dark nectar will last a long time. The malty, porter-ish aromas intrigue, followed by incredibly rich and syrupy flavors accompanied by mouthwatering acids and enormous peristence. Layers of complexity gradually unfold in the glass, revealing hints of honey, caramel and beguiling rancio notes., 98.0, 86.0
Portugal, 40-year old tawny, A superb wine, elegance and weight combined magisterially. It has all the right mature flavors, ripe fruit, intense marmalade and concentration. This is a wine with a great reputation, and the taste doesn't let that reputation down. Imported by Kobrand., 95.0, 154.0
Portugal, Late Bottled Vintage, Quite light, with acidity, fresh blackberry fruits and rather bitter tannins. There is an edge of final juiciness, but overall this seems rather harsh., 86.0, 25.0
Argentina, Catena Alta, An elevated, classy wine with earth, tobacco, leather and currant aromas. It's a little saucy and saturated, but with air it unveils layering and flavors of coconut (oak-based), leather, cassis and plum. Rich on the finish, with chocolate and rubber notes. Drink now or hold through 2011., 89.0, 57.0
US, , There's something rustic about this Cab. Partly it's the tannins, which are fierce. Partly it's the alcohol, which sticks out and gives the wine a burn. Yet it's extraordinarily ripe and opulent in black currants, with the liqueur headiness of crème de cassis. The hot alcohol suggests it will not age., 86.0, 125.0
US, Santa Barbara Historic Vineyards Collection Bien Nacido Vineyard, Chardonnay doesn't get much better than this. Bursts with grilled pineapple-infused crème brûlée, peach pie, butter-sautéed banana, passion fruit and butterscotch flavors, dusted with cinnamon and brown sugar. Yet all that opulence is balanced by perfect acidity. Totally gorgeous., 96.0, 35.0
US, , Sharp, spicy, tastes of apples, with plenty of flesh. Ripe and straightforward, showing none of the sugar, vanilla and excessive oak chip flavors of most cheap Chardonnays. Solid winemaking, juicy acids, and a fine food wine for six bucks., 87.0, 6.0
US, Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard, Beckstoffer To Kalon Cabs aren't always fabulous, because so many wineries source its fruit, but Knights Bridge has a great track record. This release is their best ever. Dry and soft in the mouth, it's drinkable now, yet so firm are the tannins that it will easily age. As for the flavors, they're incredibly complex in blackberries, black currant and licorice. Best now and through the next 10 years., 96.0, 135.0
France, Cuvée Spéciale, Made solely from old-vine Grenache, this stands out as a horse of a different color in a flight of traditional Châteauneuf-du-Papes. It does boast a lovely suppleness and silky texture, but the aromas and flavors are strange—a sort of medicinal cherry meets boiled vegetables., 84.0, 73.0
US, Martha's Vineyard, This tremendous 100% varietal wine hails from Oakville and was aged over three years in oak. Juicy red-cherry fruit and a compelling hint of caramel greet the palate, framed by elegant, fine tannins and a subtle minty tone in the background. Balanced and rewarding from start to finish, it has years ahead of it to develop further nuance. Enjoy 2022–2030., 96.0, 235.0
France, Extra Cuvée de Réserve Vintage Brut, From start to finish, this top quality vintage follows a straight line. It starts with freshness and explodes into richness. The initial very tight structure soon opens out with white pears and green plums, soft and ripe. The fruit is supported by the structure which offers orange zest. Like many 1999s, this is almost ready to drink., 93.0, 103.0
US, , Rich and smooth in tannins, with some sharpness through the finish, this shows masses of ripe blackberries and dark chocolate. A bit of time in the glass reprises and accentuates the chocolaty richness. Despite its power, this is refined and high toned, a serious cellar candidate. Give it 10–15 years., 96.0, 335.0
France, , A beautifully perfumed wine. It has a good edge of firm tannins, but the fruit is so sweet and ripe, packed with strawberry jam flavors. Very seductive, the wood spice gives an extra edge. Drink now, or age for 4–5 years., 88.0, 86.0
France, Sélection de Grains Nobles, Hugel, a firm known for its dry-styled table wines, can make killer sweet wines as well, deftly illustrated by this example. It's full-bodied, broad in the mouth and rich, with considerable weight to its flavors of roses, dried apricots, marmalade and honey, yet stays fresh on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2020., 93.0, 203.0
France, Brut Rosé Grand Cru, The 10% Pinot Noir in this otherwise Chardonnay-dominant blend adds an attractive, light pink color. It is crisp and fragrant. Pinot Noir's tannins barely show, while Chardonnay's apple-driven acidity comes through strongly., 89.0, 67.0
US, Anthology Red Wine, Based on Cabernet with the other four Bordeaux varieties blended in, this wine is in your face with sweetly ripe cassis, cherry, red licorice, cocoa, cola and vanilla flavors. It would benefit from greater subtlety and restraint., 85.0, 54.0
Portugal, Aragonês de Peceguina, Aragonês, a k a Tempranillo and Tinta Roriz, is the source of this smooth, rich wine that shows great elegance despite its high alcohol. It has concentration, very dense fruit flavors and a gorgeous ripe finish., 90.0, 70.0
US, , A little too ripe and raisiny, but not a bad Merlot, with a plush, velvety texture. There's good plum, black currant and smoky oak flavor, and the wine is dry and balanced. Drink now., 86.0, 35.0
Germany, Rauenthaler Nonnenberg Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese, Insanely priced, but if you love ultrasticky dessert wines, this is one you'll want to try at least once. Shows the merest hint of volatility on the nose, but also striking floral and mineral components. Broad and viscous on the palate, with intensely honeyed flavors of dried apricots and orange marmalade that last a long, long time. Should age virtually forever., 94.0, 283.0
US, Purple Label Piedra Hill Vineyard, You don't want to open this wine anytime soon. It's tightly wound and immature, offering a blast of primary fruit flavors that haven't yet integrated with the oak. It tastes almost sweet now, although it's technically bone dry, with waves of black cherries, blackberries, mocha, anise liqueur and smoky oak vanillins, followed by a long, spicy finish. Hold until 2012, if you can, and should drink well beyond that., 95.0, 64.0
France, , Structured, concentrated, a wine that shows power from both fruit and tannins. The opulent strawberry flavors are paralleled by firm, dry tannins. As the combination comes together, this will become a glorious wine., 95.0, 164.0
US, , This dry Sauvignon Blanc is wonderfully adaptable to today's wide variety of foods. Bone dry and crisp in acidity, it has rich, varietal flavors of Meyer lemon, lime, pink grapefruit and blood orange., 87.0, 16.0
US, Monument Ridge, A dramatic wine, authoritative in tannins, bone dry and noble. Withholds its best under a cloak of astringency, but already shows its mountain terroir in the complexity of its structure and deep, intense blackberry, currant, blueberry and dried herb flavors. Should develop bottle complexities for at least a decade and probably longer., 96.0, 45.0
Spain, , Horsey, leathery aromas are earthy and funky, although with time blackberry notes rise up. The wine is lively, tough and offers bracing acidity. Flavors of herbs, licorice and lemony acidity support core blackberry fruit, while the finish is herbal and woodsy, with dark notes of espresso and black licorice., 88.0, 96.0
US, , Dark honey gold in color, this is reminiscent of cider. It's an interesting use of ripe Chardonnay, but finishes overly sour, almost bitter., 82.0, 22.0
Italy, Sorì San Lorenzo, You cannot not love this wine: layered and intense with extraordinary integrity of fruit, it offers supple flavors of dark fruit, spice, tobacco and chocolate. It's dense, succulent and penetrating with polished tannins and long persistency. The palate becomes coated with opulence and richness: 5% Barbera is added. Drink 2015–2030., 96.0, 445.0
US, , An earthy, spicy and lean wine, veering on austere, this is elegant and softly layered. Wild strawberry, mushroom and forest combine with a subtle suggestion of black tea and cinnamon to form a delicious experience that's long-lasting on the palate., 91.0, 51.0
Canada, Sparkling Icewine, A real oddball that's musky, melony, sweet and–yes–bubbly. Vidal is a French-American hybrid with some strange petrolly aromatics that take some getting used to, and they're well-displayed in this example that gets its bubbles from fermentation in sealed tanks, trapping the naturally occurring carbon dioxide., 84.0, 83.0
US, Winemaker's Cuvée, An elegant debut for this new Oregon winery, the Winemaker's Cuvée opens with lovely floral and herbal scents, moving into a detailed, precise and well-configured palate, with pretty raspberry and cherry candy fruit. It's set in a sturdy frame of acid and tannin, and seems to gain concentration through the long finish., 92.0, 32.0
US, Prince Hill, This is an unusually buttery wine, as if it had been put through some special sort of malolactic fermentation. It feels manipulated, softened and buttered up, with the fruit subdued. Traces of herb remain, but they are like shadows on the wall. Perhaps the house style does not accommodate this particular vineyard's character. This wine makes it hard to know., 86.0, 45.0
France, , This is a very dark wine, rich in dried fruits, plums and dense tannins. The wood aging is an important element here, giving a firm and dry character. With its richness comes weight and concentration. A bitter edge suggests overextraction., 87.0, 26.0
Australia, , There are no complaints with this Chardonnay. Apple, pineapple, butter and toasted oak load the flavor package. The perfect balance and velvety mouthfeel provide a solid background. The producer recommends kangaroo tail soup with this one—but why not? You get to go to Australia, and kangaroo is low in fat and cholesterol. Best Buy., 88.0, 7.0
US, Stagecoach Vineyard, This tastes distinctly sweet—like a cherry-and-chocolate confection—and the acidity is high. It's hard to predict where this is going, but it seems awkward now. Tasted twice, with consistent results., 86.0, 145.0
Italy, Villa Rizzardi, Villa Rizzardi offers a traditional interpretation of Amarone with a leaner consistency than most and brighter aromas of forest berry, white cherry, raspberry and almond. It feels smooth and clean and would pair with spicy sausage., 89.0, 87.0
Italy, Gerione, This oak-aged Sardinian wine opens with awkward aromas of black fruit, pecorino cheese and wild mushroom that blow off after a few seconds. Ultimately, the bouquet makes sense thanks to the toasted spice and oak tones that keep it together. The wine shows a smooth and polished texture in the mouth and sweet fruit flavors., 87.0, 126.0
Spain, Figuero Noble, Rich and voluptuous on the bouquet, this has coconut, ripe blackberry and leather aromas. It feels huge, grabby, tannic and supercharged, with ultradark and chocolaty berry flavors that last long on the finish, where pepper, spice and chocolate flavors sneak into the frame. Drink 2014–2021., 92.0, 132.0
Austria, Zöbinger Heiligenstein Erste Lage Lyra Reserve, From vines trained on the lyre system, here is one of the classics of Austrian wine. Its richness and concentration are present from the first taste. As the wine opens, it brings out perfumes and intense fruit flavors. A great wine that needs long-term aging., 95.0, 74.0
US, Highwire Vineyard, The vineyard is in Fulton, a cool part of the southeastern valley heavily influenced by fog, and the vines are about 100 years old. This is great, classic Zinfandel. It should be in a museum. Despite high alcohol, it has a silky, Pinot-esque suppleness, balanced with crisp acids, and is profoundly rich in Zinny flavor. Currants, mushu plum sauce, anise, crushed black pepper, dark chocolate and rich Asian spices last forever on the finish., 96.0, 55.0
France, Premier Cru, Ripe and full of raspberries, this has a structure well cushioned by the ripe texture. The wine is packed with acidity while having a sense of floral, aromatic fruitiness. From four different parcels in premier cru, this seductive wine will also age well. Drink from 2018., 93.0, 113.0
US, Martin Stelling Vineyard, Unbelievably rich and delicious, this is a joy to drink. It continues the winery's long record with this vineyard, reaching toward its apex with this 2009. Made from 100% Cabernet and aged in nearly two-thirds new French oak, it's elaborate, layered and complex, offering juicy notes of blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate, with sweet toast and vanilla flavors that continue onto the spicy finish. If you can keep your hands off it, this will develop over the next 10–15 years., 96.0, 155.0
US, Special Selection, Beautiful wine, lush and soft in the style of this warm vintage. It's immediately enjoyable for the wealth of cherries, blackberries and raspberries, with a decadent edge of melted milk chocolate. Oak adds extra dimensions of smoky vanilla, caramel, butterscotch and gingerbread. Those who think they don't like red wine will enjoy. Hard to tell if it has the stuffing for the long haul, but it's gorgeous now and for the next six years., 97.0, 136.0
Italy, Rio Sordo, Subtle aromas include crushed flower, forest floor, graphite, black berry and a note of menthol. The ripe palate offers red cherry-berry and a hint of cinnamon alongside muted but drying tannins. Drink through 2021., 89.0, 97.0
Italy, , Pretty notes of dark chocolate and spice are well integrated within notes of blackberry and forest floor. This is a modern interpretation of a traditional wine that leaves enough space for the grape's rustic charm and sharp acidity to come through., 88.0, 17.0
France, Grands Poisots Premier Cru, Soft, open wine, very much in character with the appellation. It does lack some depth, and is more surface freshness and fruitiness. That means it is not for long aging, but is certainly fresh and delicious now., 87.0, 36.0
Italy, Terre di Rivolta Riserva, This Aglianico opens with aromas of new oak, vanilla, chocolate and overripe black fruit, all of which carry over to the one-dimensional palate. It seems tired, and the sugary sweetness, dense concentration and evident alcohol give the wine a lumbering character., 86.0, 55.0
US, Reserve, This is a blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc, and all of the fruit came from old vines from two of Washington's most revered vineyards, Champoux and Weinbau. Supple and ripe, it's packed with a brilliant, flavorful mix of berries, cherries and cassis. The tannins are polished, and the barrel-derived notes of toast, cinnamon, coffee and caramel linger through the long, smooth finish., 96.0, 65.0
France, , Corton-Charlemagne has produced a powerful and concentrated wine. The massive, opulent feel is balanced by tropical fruits and acids, which are layered between the toast and spice notes. It needs many years to mature., 96.0, 165.0
Spain, Les Eres Vinyes Velles, A great Priorat, plain and simple. And while we have always liked Les Eres from Joan Simó, this vintage is the best we've tried. The nose is beautiful: coffee, cola, schist, black fruit and herbs rise up. In the mouth, there's strength but restraint; huge black fruit, pulsing tannins and subtleties. Power and precision as well. A brilliant wine that can be drunk now with decanting, or better: hold for another 4–12 years., 95.0, 84.0
France, Cuvée William Deutz Brut, What a delicious wine. It shows the mineral, almost steely character of 1996. Flavors of grapefruit and green apples are pure and intense; a touch of toast wraps it up. Will develop over many years., 95.0, 184.0
Moldova, Select, Purple, grapey fruit flavors are simple but good, with hints of clay. Tannins are light, offering little structure. Aromas are a bit muddled, red berry one minute then mint and leather the next, with wafts of weediness., 83.0, 13.0
US, , Chateau Ste. Michelle makes more Riesling than any winery in the country, and this bottling, at 553,500 cases, may qualify as the largest single Riesling production in the world. It's a great bottle of wine, priced for everyday consumption, yet loaded with fresh fruit flavors of peach, pear and melon. Washington state built its white wine reputation on Riesling, and Riesling is more popular than ever before (statewide it is the third most planted grape, and production is up 23 percent in the past two years). This version is off-dry, lightly spiced and perfectly framed by vibrant acids., 89.0, 8.0
Australia, Ashmead Single Vineyard, This wine ticks all the boxes, but just lacks the excitement and drama to take it to the next level. Smoke and vanilla notes add interest to the juicy, easy-to-drink cassis fruit. There's ample but not too much weight on the palate. Supple tannins. Perhaps it just needs additional cellaring time to warrant the price, although it doesn't come across as needing it in the structural sense., 89.0, 108.0
US, Mirabelle Brut Rosé, This has the pretty color of pink copper, a delicately yeasty aroma; and rich, sweet flavors of strawberry, lime and toast. It's a little scouring on the palate. The blend is nearly equal parts Pinot Noir and Chardonnay., 88.0, 27.0
Italy, Camartina, Mostly Cabernet with 305 Sangiovese, Camartina is a thick, solid, streamlined wine that shows the highest level of winemaking expertise. Sweet cherry, bramble, espresso, plum, blackberry peel off layer after layer. The wine boasts chewy tannins and a bold mouthfeel. Drink after 2012., 94.0, 104.0
Spain, Erial Tradición Familia, Big, rich and extremely impressive given the price; this wine competes with and beats some Riberas that cost five times more. It's textured, deep, silky and layered, with integrated berry, plum and cassis flavors. Packed and generous all the way to the finish; drink now or cellar for up to 10 more years. From 80-year-old Tempranillo vines., 93.0, 23.0
US, Chateaux du Lovall, Sweet and soft, with ripe berry flavors that veer into grilled cherries, chocolate and even Port. The finish is frankly sweet., 82.0, 32.0
France, , From a 3.75-acre parcel of this grand cru, this is stunning red Burgundy, amazingly complex, lushly fruited and—yes—ageworthy. Plum and black cherry flavors lead the way, but they're joined by notes of meat, earth, wild game, mushroom and saddle leather. Full and lush in the mouth, this is richly tannic but not hard, as some vintages have been in the past., 93.0, 123.0
US, , Sweet in blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors, this Cab shows complex Napa tannins and is balanced with adequate acidity. It's a bit direct, but may develop bottle complexities over the next few years., 86.0, 65.0
US, As The Crow Flies, Nearly all Syrah, with a splash of Viognier, this wine comes from some of the best vineyards in the Santa Ynez and Los Alamos Valleys, including the Happy Canyon area. It's a dramatic glass of red wine, bone dry and fairly tannic, with vast, intricate flavors of blackberries, black currants, teriaki beef, cherries, red licorice, cola, dark chocolate and toast. The Viognier brings a brightening dash of citrus and acidity. An extraordinary wine that will drink well through 2014., 96.0, 75.0
US, , This is dry, crisp in acidity and pleasantly exotic in tropical fruit, orange, vanilla and spice flavors. It shows a respectable quality-price ratio and is worth seeking out, although the case production is fairly low., 89.0, 18.0
France, Les Pucelles Premier Cru, As Anne-Claude Leflaive describes it, this wine is all about the complexity of the vineyard's soil. There is minerality and finesse from the chalk, which gives a structure. And at the same time the ripe fruit seems opulent, with vanilla and spice flavors adding something exotic. Age this wine for at least 5 years., 96.0, 175.0
US, , This full-bodied, 100% Cabernet is lightly gamy, offering a sensuous potpourri of wild herbs and brambly berries. It's subtle, lovely, distinctive, smoothly rendered and unusually textural and complex. Drink it with enjoyment now, or give it a few more years in the cellar., 92.0, 42.0
Italy, D'Alceo, D'Alceo is a drop dead gorgeous wine that oozes intensity, blackness, fruitiness, exotic spice and smoke. In the mouth, this beautifully executed super Tuscan is about as rich, smooth and opulent as they come. You'll love the lingering notes of mature berry, chocolate and espresso that drive the long, smooth finish., 96.0, 275.0
US, , A blend of Bishop Creek and Eyrie fruit, from multiple vintages. Spicy, refined, with interesting spice and herb streaks dominating. Cracker and seed flavors abound, more than berries or fruit. Tannins are soft and supple; and the wine is drinking well right now., 88.0, 37.0
Italy, Parafada, Massolino's Parafada Barolo is a stunningly beautiful wine with bold, confident aromas of black fruit, tobacco, cigar box, cherry cola, clove, nutmeg and vanilla bean. The mouthfeel is bright, lively, velvety and, generally speaking, the 2006 vintage represents a big jump over 2005., 95.0, 94.0
US, Joy!, Aged on the lees for 13 years, this wine has developed stunning creaminess and complexity. Made from 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay, it shows a hazelnut smokiness, with fantastically rich, subtle layers of limes, apples, tangerine zest, minerals and yeast. There's a honeyed richness to the finish, which balances high acidity, making it feel dry. A tremendous brut that should develop for years to come. Now–2020, in a cool cellar. Production was 50 cases., 98.0, 147.0
Italy, Privilegio, Everything about this dessert wine—its color, consistency and body—is smooth and seductive until your nose encounters a solid wall of wood. A tad too much toast, in my opinion, translates into blackened bread crust and peanut oil warming in an iron skillet and makes it difficult to locate the dried flowers and fruit aromas. Yet the wood does frame the wine's sweetness nicely and some may love it., 87.0, 56.0
Spain, , This opens with standard cherry and berry aromas before transitioning to a juicy palate with red berry, plum, herb and grass notes. It finishes a little hot and aggressive, but for $4 who's complaining?, 84.0, 4.0
US, Estate, Good concentration and a classic Oregon Pinot mix of herb and fruit characterize this winning effort. Dried herb, thistle, berry, cherry and a Dr. Pepper streak are all in the mix, with hints of earth and stem., 89.0, 28.0
Italy, Riserva, Aromas that recall sugared plum, espresso, toast and underbrush lead the way on this robust wine. The densely concentrated palate offers stewed prune, vanilla, mocha, coffee and toasted oak alongside grainy tannins that leave a teeth-coating, tongue-drying finish. It's extremely ripe and you'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on close., 89.0, 128.0
US, , Here's a young wine not offering much now beyond tons of ripe cherry and blackberry fruit and sharp, immature acids and tannins. It's well made, with a toasty oak edge. You might want to age it for a couple years., 86.0, 75.0
Italy, , Fresh and full of finesse, this radiant red offers rose, forest floor, woodland berry, new leather and pipe tobacco scents. The palate delivers juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, wild herb and white pepper notes, finishing on star anise. Taut, refined tannins and bright acidity give it intensity, lift and balance. Give it time to develop to its full potential. Drink 2020–2032., 96.0, 85.0
US, Baker Ridge Vineyard Estate, Richly intense, this wine wraps thick textures of caramel and toffee around tropical mango. The full body celebrates ripeness while finding enough restraint., 88.0, 47.0
US, Quella, A bit overripe and raisiny-pruny despite some rich blackberry flavors, with hard, drying tannins and some bitterness. Doesn't show the lushness and appeal of the other Bonds. Could surprise down the road, but it's just average now., 86.0, 275.0
Australia, Grange, As unevolved as they are, the dense and multilayered aromas and flavors are truly impressive here. Black currant, herb, tea, oak, vanilla, maple, anise, blueberries and more--it could be an excercise in overkill, if all the parts weren't in such fine harmony. Really big, but with excellent balance, this reveals much less now than the RWT. It is everything a flagship wine in its infancy should be--immaculate component parts, superbly full on the palate, possessed of great length and incredible potential. An absolute keeper to visit in 7, 15 or 25 years. To be released 5/01., 96.0, 185.0
US, Reserve, The 2004 vintage was a rough ride in Washington, and Ste. Michelle generously shared a lot of fruit from their vineyards that escaped the freeze. One senses that Snoqualmie drew the short straw, as these 2004 reserve wines are well below the quality that this outstanding value producer has shown in the past. This is not reserve quality by any stretch of the imagination; it's light, watery and vegetal., 83.0, 23.0
US, Klopp Ranch, Amazingly rich, offering deep, complex layers of cherries, black raspberries, cola, anise biscotti, pomegranates, persimmons, black tea, orange zest, mushrooms, you name it, but don't forget the spices, everything from cloves and black pepper to cinnamon. Utterly delicious, with a silky, briskly clean mouthfeel. But the tannins are pronounced. They're not so strong as to lock the wine down, but do suggest time in the cellar. Give it four years, and it could be wonderful after 10 or more., 98.0, 57.0
US, Ciel du Cheval, A bit more austere (for the moment) than the Champoux bottling, this has the vineyard's characteristically tight streak of mineral running through its core. Mixed scents suggest hay and pie cherries. There is plenty of substantial viscosity, but nothing heavy about the mouthfeel. This is sleek, deceptively light, tasting of stones, with soft hints of berry, good acids and nothing sharp or bitter., 93.0, 33.0
Italy, Inversus, This oak-aged Merlot, which includes 10% Sangiovese for extra acidity and brightness, opens with spice, wood shop, toasted almond and ripe cherry notes. It offers a chewy, succulent quality, and it finishes with a dark fruit flavor., 89.0, 38.0
Germany, Wildenstein R Trocken, The high-quality oak used in this wine really stands out, providing touches of brown sugar, cinnamon, coffee and bacon to the otherwise modest black cherry fruit. It's reasonably full-bodied for a German Pinot Noir, with a long finish and supple tannins., 89.0, 138.0
Australia, Descendant, Unlike most of the Torbreck wines, this is single-vineyard Shiraz, cofermented with a small proportion of Viognier, then aged in barrels previously used for RunRig. Hints of apricot and bacon fat impart beautiful nuance to the blackberry fruit. This is slightly firmer than Torbreck's other reds, worth cellaring for five years or so, then drinking over the next 15., 95.0, 105.0
France, , The wine shows the power typical of a Lafite but within the context of the fruity 2011 vintage. The immensely dense tannic structure gives the wine a solid feel that is lifted by so much ripe black currant and berry fruits. At the back, the wine has a more brooding, dark character that suggests great aging potential. Drink this wine from 2019., 96.0, 685.0
France, , From arguably the finest white wine vineyard in Burgundy, this is a powerful wine that shows great weight, but balances that with intense, elegant structure, style and freshness. The flavors are endless and complex, richness combining with the lively character of the vintage. Age for many years., 98.0, 757.0
France, Clos de Vougeot, Powerful, opulent and rounded, this is a dense wine. Drouhin owns two parcels on the eastern edge of the slope of Clos de Vougeot, and the wine does show great rich swathes of plums, dry figs, chocolate and sweet jelly, balanced by firm tannins and bright, always rich acidity. An impressive wine., 95.0, 205.0
France, Brut Rosé, A soft wine that is full of strawberry fruits to go with a sweet citrus edge. The wine has good acidity, in a light apéritif style with pure final raspberry juice., 88.0, 57.0
US, 1/1, An eccentric wine, very high in alcohol, yet there's a strange vegetal element. Otherwise, it's all about sweet blackberry jam, mushu plum sauce, white pepper and charred bacon. The green veggie note, which winemaker Matthias Pippig describes as “savage”, persists into the finish., 86.0, 85.0
Portugal, 40-year old tawny, A very sweet rich wine, in the Fonseca house style. But it lacks the intensity, going more for sweet almonds, along with some bitter marmalade, and a young taste. Imported by Kobrand., 88.0, 157.0
Portugal, Cabeça de Burro Reserva, This is a smooth but heavily wood-influenced wine with light blackberry fruits, a layer of firm tannins, and very fresh acidity. Not for aging, but enjoyable for its fruity, lightweight character., 84.0, 14.0
US, Monitor Ledge Vineyard, This is an extraordinarily ripe, flashy Cabernet Sauvignon, one of Duckhorn's new red wines that is among the most impressive in years. The wine is densely packed in sweet red and black currant fruit, chocolate and licorice flavors, wrapped into firm tannins, with a bone-dry finish. Just fantastic to experience now, and it should easily develop over at least a decade., 96.0, 95.0
France, Cristal Rosé Brut, Orange-pink in color, this a super-rich rosé. The flavors are of orange zest, citrus and red currants, with a beautiful contrast of hazelnuts. The texture, round and succulent, is still able to offer minerality and a crisp aftertaste., 95.0, 505.0
US, Ardore, Young and succulent, this is fresh, with ripe flavors of blackberries, cassis, chocolate and herb, with a toasty overlay of oak. Powerful, but not overbearing, this shows an internal coherence that lifts it to a high level of elegant complexity. As good as it is, it will benefit from 8-12 years in a proper cellar., 96.0, 195.0
US, Dutton Thomas Road Vineyard, An interesting wine that makes you think. Straddles the border between minty wintergreen unripeness and cherry-cola ripeness, coming down in favor of the latter. Streamlined and elegant, it's good now for the dry crispness, but not an ager. Drink soon., 89.0, 48.0
France, Les Vaucrains Premier Cru, For the vintage, this is a surprisingly soft wine. It's already juicy, full of fresh strawberries and soft tannins. That makes for a delicious wine, rounded with a touch of wood. It's not likely to age much beyond 2017,  but is certainly attractive now., 89.0, 148.0
France, Blason Brut Rosé, Salmon to onion-skin pink in color, this is a rosé with a relatively high level of dosage and a soft finish. There are red fruits, but also nuts and a citrus kick on the finish. A very smooth Champagne. Imported by Allied Domecq Wines USA., 87.0, 76.0
Italy, Sorì San Lorenzo, There's always something magical about Gaja's Sorì San Lorenzo. It's the intensity and fullness of the wine that penetrates to the back of the palate and offers many long minutes of persistency on the finish. The bouquet is redolent of black fruit, leather, spice, tar, licorice and dried herb., 96.0, 495.0
Italy, Darmagi, Here is a rock-solid Cabernet embellished by a delicate aromatic embroidery that gives its Piedmont origins away. Dark ruby in color, the nose is perfectly seamless with ripe fruit nuances at the core and generous notes of asphalt, resin and blackberry. The tannins and structure are solid and the wine's enduring persistence can be counted in long, delicious minutes., 94.0, 224.0
South Africa, Cabernet Sauvignon Methode Ancienne, From its wax seal, its older vintage (this is the current release) and its name, expect interesting things. You won't be disappointed. The wines come from a small parcel of land on the estate that was long considered too poor to plant. Native yeasts, whole berry fermentation and no filtering—that's the methode ancienne part. There are just 20 barrels of poised, elegant wine with huge depth of flavor, black cherries and dense tannins blending well together., 92.0, 52.0
France, Champ Gain Premier Cru, A fresh, light, crisp wine with some good mineral overtones layered with toast. While it doesn't have great complexity, this is an attractive, citrusy wine that's ready to drink now., 88.0, 67.0
France, Clos des Mouches Premier Cru, Following an unfortunate Chanson white wine style, this wine is totally dominated by new, high toast wood. It shows freshness, but the acidity comes from the wood, leaving the structured fruit way behind., 85.0, 105.0
France, Clos des Cortons Faiveley Grand Cru, This is tough as nails right now, but also packed with almost liqueur-like black cherry fruit. Meaty nuances and chocolate-fudge richness are stopped abruptly by firm, astringent tannins on the finish. It's too tannic to enjoy now; the question is whether it will resemble one of the great '47 red Burgundies with age, or dry out like some of the '76s., 88.0, 167.0
France, Les Varennes, The Quarts de Chaume, the four fingers of land that rise above the Layon Valley, are one of the pinnacles of sweet wines in the Loire. Showing botrytis and layers of dryness over the honey and peach jelly flavors, but also has great freshness. The aftertaste just lasts., 92.0, 152.0
Germany, Trockenbeerenauslese Goldlack, So incredibly thick and sweet it's almost chewy in texture, with aromas and flavors that feature a fascinating interplay of fresh and dried apricots, peach and citrus, kept lively by healthy acidity. The finish lasts for minutes; the wine should age well for decades., 97.0, 486.0
France, , Somehow Barton has overcome the heat of the 2003 vintage and has come out with a new wine that is rich and elegant. There are generous tannins, ripe black currant fruits, balancing acidity, all in an ensemble that is so much more than the sum of its parts. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates., 95.0, 115.0
Australia, , Different from most McLaren Vale wineries, at Pannell the Shiraz is softer and more approachable than the Grenache. This one delivers plummy, chocolaty fruit with hints of green peppercorns and mocha, a smooth, even texture and a bit of espresso on the finish. Drink now–2015., 89.0, 58.0
US, Re dei Re Vintner's Reserve, Rather soft and candied, with fruity-sweet flavors of cherries, raspberries, chocolate and cedar. Drink now–2010 for freshness., 86.0, 95.0
France, Les Folatières Premier Cru, A wine that brings out intense minerality, a tight citric tang and a beautiful structure. With its lime and grapefruit acidity laid over ripe yellow fruits shot through with toast, this is a wine that should age many years, mellowing into an open, generous richness., 95.0, 215.0
US, , Bing cherries rise to the top of the aroma profile, but the flavors, like many 2011s, appear unwilling to share themselves in any forward way, even after the wine is opened for some time. It necessitates much searching to get past the tart and lean vintage to find the limited but characteristic flavors of Pinot Noir., 83.0, 33.0
US, Claret, Atlas Peak, now under the ownership of Beam Wine Estates, is reinventing itself.  This new wine, by veteran winemaker Darren Procsal, shows promise. It's a big, dry Cab, not as astringent as in the past but still tannic enough to demand cellaring. Should be better between 2009 and 2015, but it's a gamble., 87.0, 86.0
France, , Sure, this wine shows the effects of the hot summer in its slightly jammy raspberry flavors, but there's also incredible complexity to complement the fruit intensity—Asian spices, tea, pepper and meat, to name just a few nuances. It's all wrapped in a blanket of soft tannins, but stays fresh-tasting thanks to great minerality despite low acidity. Drink now–2030 or beyond., 97.0, 96.0
France, Noblesse d'Or Brut Rosé, This new Champagne brand's rosé is soft, with a sweet strawberry flavor. It has a fine balance of acidity and ripe fruit, with a crisp finish despite the intruding sweetness., 86.0, 495.0
Germany, Graacher Himmelreich Vat 46 Eiswein, Sweet and bracingly tart at the same time, with racy acidity framing sweet orange and lime flavors. Flourishes of bergamot and cinnamon add complexity on the nose and reprise on the long finish., 93.0, 143.0
US, ReZerve, At 15.8% alcohol and observable sweetness, we really are talking Port here. It's a good wine, rich and clean and loaded with chocolate and cherry fruit, but is clearly not a dry table wine., 84.0, 24.0
Italy, , Nice ripeness, fullness and generosity here. The bouquet opens with bold brushstrokes that don't match the delicate, subdued feel in the mouth. It delivers most of its energy on the nose and segues to a much calmer, more straightforward style on the close., 89.0, 68.0
Spain, Cuesta Del Aire, Dry and not all that fruity up front, with a blast of oak. The palate shows weight and bold acidity, which pumps up the lemon, apple and pineapple flavors. A bit sour, scouring and sharp, but also cleansing and fresh. Blunt white wine., 85.0, 15.0
France, Le Méal, At five years of age, this is still a young wine, keeping much of its appeal firmly under wraps. The tight aromas and flavors only gradually reveal hints of their future grandeur in tantalizing glimpses of honey, anise, orange peel and pineapple. Yet the neverending length and pronounced minerality to this wine's finish leaves no doubt of its ultimate quality. Try after 2010?, 94.0, 134.0
US, Boushey Vineyard Sirocco Blanc, Among McCrea's Rhône-inspired white wines, this is the most complete and complex. It's rich and dense, with honeycomb, lychee, lemon rind, pineapple and lots of stone—lovely and lingering. It seems to gain strength as it rolls through a sensational finish., 95.0, 25.0
US, , Very strong for the price point; this has cassis and tar, spice and herb along with tart, berry-flavored fruit. Acids are strong and provide a good underpinning, and the tannins carry a fair amount of herbaceousness. This has the heft and muscle of much more expensive wines., 86.0, 6.0
US, Rattlesnake Hill Estate Bottled, A tremendous wine that easily merits being Barnett's most expensive release. Shows the ripe blackberry and black currant flavors and new oak that are so easily achieved, with yet near perfect tannins and a dryness unusual in a Cabernet this fruity. The combination of opposites makes this mountain wine noteworthy, as well as ageable. Now–2017., 95.0, 125.0
France, , This is a soft and fruity wine with excellent acidity to balance. With its jammy red berry fruit flavors and attractive gentle tannins, it is ready to drink., 87.0, 96.0
US, Herb Lamb Vineyard, Almost black in color. Flavors are of blackberry, cassis, Provençal herbs; the 100% new oak adds rich toast and char notes. Tannins are brilliant, dense and fluffy. Grown at the base of Howell Mountain, this is classic mountain Cab, beautiful now, fleshy and fat, but with a 20-year lifespan., 95.0, 225.0
US, Rainin Vineyard, This blockbuster, powerhouse of a wine suggests blueberry pie and chocolate as it opens in the glass. On the palate, it's smooth and seductively silky, offering complex cedar, peppercorn and peppery oak seasonings amidst its dense richness. It finishes with finesse and spice., 95.0, 325.0
Australia, Isabella Rare, Dark amber in color and going greenish at the rim, the basis of this wine is clearly old stocks going back well over 60 years. It's full-bodied, unctuous and superrich, oozing with molasses and rancio character, but balanced by citrusy notes. The finish is incredibly sweet and long, coating the mouth with coffee-like essences that linger for minutes., 98.0, 97.0
US, Rochioli Riverblock, Among the heavier, softer and more extracted of the winery's fall offerings. It shows the ripeness and full-bodied richness of the block, with powerful cherry, pomegranate, cola and spice flavors, and is very dry and classically proportioned. But it's not the greatest Riverblock ever. Drink now–2015., 89.0, 78.0
US, Reserve, Opens with a solid Cabernet nose of black currants. The tannins here are fine and dispersed, the acidity is a little low in the current fashion, yielding a plush mouthfeel. Finishes long and spicy, but maybe a touch superficially pretty., 90.0, 80.0
Australia, Hill of Grace, This stellar wine takes a little time in the glass to show its true class, but once it's properly aerated, the aromas go from rather vague and lifted to plummy and spice laden. In the mouth, it's rich, creamy-textured and lush, offering the flavors of plum pudding without the excessive weight that the words suggest, plus hints of grilled meat. Again, with airing, it gets even better, piling on more red fruit notes and turning more elegant. A great example of Shiraz, but how many people will be able to justify the $25/ounce expenditure?, 95.0, 625.0
US, Sanford & Benedict Vineyard, A thick, young, closed wine with a soft, cloying texture, and jammy fruit and sugared coffee flavors. It's also hot. Might age., 82.0, 52.0
France, , By using the brand Joseph Faiveley for its négociant wines, made from purchased grapes, Faiveley is able to distinguish this range from its domaine wines. This Gevrey is luxuriously perfumed, finely structured with dusty tannins and already delicious Pinot Noir. It has a fine strain of acidity, which adds freshness to the solid character., 91.0, 71.0
Greece, , Cinnamon, vanilla, coffee and red berries on the nose are followed by flavors of pepper, cinnamon and forest berries in this plucky Syrah. Spicy with a spin of tart fruit, the wine nevertheless has a full-bodied feel., 84.0, 34.0
US, Reserve, A tough, gritty wine, marked by strongly astringent tannins. Underneath are fine blackberry, cherry, currant, mineral, floral and pepper flavors with hints of chocolate and cassis. But the mouthfeel is so tannic it detracts from the pleasure, nor does the wine seem ageable., 85.0, 25.0
US, , Good everyday Chard, with direct flavors of pineapples and kiwis, and the buttercream and smoky vanillins that oak barrels contribute. Finishes dry and crisp., 86.0, 16.0
France, Cuvée Ste. Cathérine, Subtle notes of orange meet freshly-cut pear flavors, amplified by some residual sugar. The richness of the palate is cut beautifully by a fresh and pure, citric acidity and a wrought phenolic structure which lends pleasant notes of subtle, enticing bitterness. There is something bittersweet about this that is touching and alluring., 93.0, 53.0
Portugal, Vintage, A good choice for current consumption, the 1985 Dow's shows a touch of bricking to go along with developed aromas of cedar, clove and cinnamon. Cherry, plum, fennel and dried spice notes finish with a hint of toffee. Drink now–2015., 88.0, 97.0
US, Estate Grown, This very interesting wine treads a delicate balance between exuberantly ripe persimmons and cherries, and earthier notes of red tomatoes. But those tomatoes are rich and satisfying, like summer heirloom varieties picked fresh off the vine that are sweet as a peaches. Veteran Stemmler, who can usually be depended on to turn out serious Pinot Noir, has succeeded here, giving us a delicious wine for drinking now, but one whose balance should protect it for 6–8 years., 94.0, 44.0
US, Limited Release Cold Springs Vineyard, A helping of Petit Verdot adds to the strength and power of this gigantic, full-bodied wine, which shows elements of waxy plum, dried herb and even a touch of bell pepper on the palate, not quite resolved., 85.0, 125.0
US, Boushey Vineyard Le Midi, As excellent as this was was in 2009, the 2010 has reached an almost-ethereal level. The aromatics alone are transportive, with the concentrated essence of raspberries and blueberries at optimal ripeness. The flavors are deep and long, elegant and powerful, and they lead into a finish that's anchored in notes of mineral and dark chocolate., 95.0, 35.0
Italy, Sassicaia, Not the best vintage  for Sassicaia enthusiasts or collectors, but certainly noteworthy thanks to defined herbal aromas such as rosemary and sage backed by black plum, black berry, tobacco, cigar box and leather. The mouthfeel is velvety and supple with unmistakable elegance delivered over a long, menthol-like finish., 90.0, 180.0
France, Belle Epoque Brut, This shimmers with its flavors of apple and lime, its hint of toast and its soft finish. It's finely balanced, a great selection that is ready to drink now., 94.0, 144.0
US, Révélation, The winemakers call this their Pauillac-style wine, meaning that its character is marked by Cabernet Sauvignon. It's a brilliant wine, vastly deep, imposing and elegant, with a potent mountain flavor of black currant. The estate vineyard is very high in the Mayacamas Mountains, and you can sense the small size of the berries in the wines intensity, the sheer concentration, as well as the tannins—which are hard and tight. Clearly this is a wine that requires time in the cellar. Try in 2018, but it could worth aging well beyond that., 95.0, 135.0
France, La Grand Année Brut Rosé, This grand rosé is rich and rounded. Its red fruit flavors are layered with toast and spice notes, with depth that gives the wine another dimension of complexity. It could age in the bottle for at least 3–4 years., 95.0, 235.0
Portugal, Cabriz Colheita Seleccionada, A great value wine, its firm tannins surrounded by the freshest berry fruits and acidity. For drinking young, with its attractive ripe, open flavors., 88.0, 8.0
France, Clos des Argillières Premier Cru, Initially spicy, this wine then develops an awkward barnyard character that is hard to shake off. The tannins are firm, dry, but sit at one side of the wine, leaving bitter fruit. This is a tough wine, not properly in balance., 88.0, 108.0
Italy, Danieli, Floral aromas recall jasmine and other spring flowers along with a whiff of graphite. The linear palate offers yellow peach, golden apples, citrus and a mineral note. White almond marks the finish., 87.0, 17.0
US, Home Ranch, Those used to the fabulous richness of Ed Sbragia's Chardonnays at Beringer might find this disappointing. It's a good wine, with the Burgundian formula of half-barrel fermention in new oak, malolactic fermentation and weekly lees stirring, so it has those winemaker-added notes of creamy, yeasty smokiness. Yet the underlying pear and apple flavors are a little thin., 86.0, 26.0
Greece, Domaine Hatzimichalis Kapnias, Vibrant and fresh citrus aromas lead on this white blend from Greece. Lemon zest, orange marmalade and spice flavors on the palate are simple but good. Pair with grilled sardines, mussels, or a fresh salad., 85.0, 35.0
Italy, Sassicaia, This supremely elegant and age-worthy Sassicaia opens with an intense bouquet of black cherry, Mediterranean herbs, blue flower, cedar and leather aromas. Powerful but graceful, the palate delivers a vibrant core of black cherry accented with white pepper, mineral and balsamic notes alongside youthful but polished tannins and vibrant acidity. It's not as exuberant as some of its counterparts, but it may outlive all the other Bolgheri 2010s. Drink 2018–2040., 97.0, 227.0
US, Rancho Santa Rosa Vineyard, A gorgeous Pinot Noir whose translucent silkiness and delicacy mask a wine of considerable potency. Shows true elegance in the racy mouthfeel and dryness, with compelling, complex flavors of tart red cherries, pomegranates, rhubarb, orange peel, rose petal, vanilla and smoke. Distinguished and ageworthy. Now–2013., 95.0, 45.0
France, Diamant Rosé, A very soft, creamy wine that seems to miss the fruit flavors, but still delivers an attractive if somewhat unfocused taste. Drink now., 85.0, 135.0
US, Jake's Vineyard Old Vine, Rustic and sweet as jam you spread on toast, this Zin shows cherry, black raspberry and pepper flavors, wrapped into edgy, slightly green tannins. Robust and briary. Drink now., 84.0, 44.0
France, Les Rocoules, Honeyed and nutty on the nose, this appears at first sniff to be very ripe and rich. And the palate follows through, delivering waves of fabulously rich fruit that miraculously don't seem heavy. A marvel., 95.0, 145.0
US, , Like the '01, this beautifully structured wine is supple and racy, with tart zippy fruit. It shows classic Washington berry flavors, with cassis, bright acid and a hint of licorice. Absolutely clean and varietal, with the extra dimension rarely found in wines at this price., 89.0, 9.0
France, Vertige, From a single parcel, situated just south of Condrieu, this wine takes its name from the fact the vineyard has an almost vertical slope, with a full south exposure. Full of exotic perfumes, it is ripe, with exotic fruits, a taste of violets and light acidity., 89.0, 109.0
Italy, Le Vigne, This gorgeous Barolo has a penetrating, dark color and generous aromas of black cherry, tar, leather, tobacco, spice, black truffle and Spanish cedar. The intensity and power is impressive, and the mouthfeel is packed tight with ripe fruit flavors and a bold structure. Hold for 10–20 years to let those tannins evolve., 94.0, 154.0
Portugal, Reserva Branco, A wood- aged wine that is ripe and smooth. It has only the barest hint of toastiness, the wood serving more to fill out the rich fruitiness. It does need to age, so drink from 2017., 88.0, 18.0
Italy, Sorì Tildìn, Dense and concentrated in appearance, Sorì Tildìn (with 5% Barbera) is the plushest and roundest of Gaja's single-vineyard wines. Thanks to the quality of the fruit, the excellent vintage and 12 months of barrique, the final result is an austere and important wine with deep tones of black cherry, licorice, anise, tobacco and cedar. It closes after many long minutes with decisive tannins and cooling freshness. Drink after 2020., 95.0, 445.0
US, , Here's a nice, smooth-drinking red wine that's rich enough to serve with your best fare. The balance is nice, with crisp acids and tannins framing cherry, red currant and mocha flavors. Try this medium-bodied wine as an alternative to Cabernet or Merlot., 87.0, 27.0
US, Red Wine, Soft and melted in the modern Napa style, a blend of Merlot and Cab sauv and Franc. With dry blackberry and oak flavors, the wine represents the triumph of international winemaking over terroir., 86.0, 36.0
Italy, , Here is a tight and polished Barolo with a touch of ripe fruit surrounded by leather, black pepper, cola, pressed violets and tar. The wine reflects the characteristics of both the Langhe and the Nebbiolo grape variety: it's elegant, structured and needs some cellar aging., 89.0, 19.0
Italy, Riserva, Funky but not unpleasant aromas of game, scorched earth and cured meat are joined by whiffs of wild berry and leather. The palate shows dried cherry, aniseed, and grilled sage alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to enjoy the remaining fruit., 89.0, 119.0
France, Cave Privée Brut Rosé, This very pale rosé has the richness of toast and croissant that comes from complete maturity. It also features fresh hints of the red and white fruits that were present during the wine's younger years. This is ready to drink now., 96.0, 246.0
France, Le Dragon, A bit reticent, offering apple, lily and spring flowers for an opening act, followed by citrus flavors on the palate. The short-to-medium finish has a pleasant lemon edge. Drink up., 85.0, 45.0
US, , The Black Eyed Peas' singer Fergie and renowned winemaker Joey Tensley present an in-your-face Viognier, deeply yellow, nearing brown in color, with aromas of dried apricot, honey-roasted nuts and smoky mezcal with lime. Lush flavors of burnt orange peel, smoke and Scotch whisky make for an intriguing drink, certainly not for those seeking a dainty white wine., 88.0, 28.0
US, Botrytised, This is one of the sweetest white California dessert wines out there. It's addictively decadent, like an upscale Sauternes. Barrel fermentation in new French oak gives an opulent, palate-flattering honeyed vanilla richness to the apricot, peach, pineapple and crème brûlée flavors that are so rich and refined. Crisp acidity provide clean, vibrant balance. Just gorgeous, and worth the price., 95.0, 55.0
Portugal, 40-year old tawny, An intensely sweet wine, with mature fruit that shows some richness and orange marmalade flavors. It is spoiled by a hint of volatility, which leaves a sharp aftertaste. Imported by Admiral Imports., 88.0, 128.0
France, , Still way too young, this is developing into a substantial and structured wine. Full of both fruit and tannins, it is dark and dense, very dry at this stage but with the most enticing perfumes. The Grand Cru, split between Chambolle-Musigny and Morey Saint-Denis, is known for its structure and this wine is a great example. Drink from 2020., 93.0, 463.0
France, , This is a powerhouse of a wine. It is driven forward by immense tannins as well as by superrich fruit that still keeps itself in check by a velvet texture. There is spice, acidity, some toast and vanilla, and finally a sunburst of warmth., 98.0, 138.0
Italy, Rennina, This drop-dead gorgeous Brunello (from Angelo Gaja's estate in Montalcino) boasts the beauty and charm of a vineyard that is blossoming with quality and intensity of fruit. You'll get traditional notes of black licorice and cherry liqueur backed by elegant notes of spice and earth., 95.0, 155.0
Italy, Conteisa, Gaja's answer to Barolo, Conteisa means “contested” in Piedmontese and refers to the historic feud between the towns of Barolo and La Morra for the shared Cerequio cru. This gorgeous wine is thick and dark with beautiful concentration and sophisticated notes of dark fruit, mineral and exotic spice. The wine is smooth and solid with firm tannins and structure. It will age for 20-plus years., 95.0, 255.0
France, Les Chaliots, This needs a good bit of breathing time, then it begins to reveal some cherry lifesaver fruit and a balanced structure with firm acids and medium tannins. A bit chalky in the finish, it's a relatively light style that is pleasant and pretty once it has opened up., 87.0, 37.0
US, , This wine is dull and diluted in nebulous black fruit and a medium-sized body, with plenty of supportive tannins. The finish is quick., 84.0, 54.0
Austria, Therese, A classic, full-bodied, easy-drinking Styrian Sauvignon Blanc, packed with tropical fruits, ripeness and just a touch of herbaceous character. There's a lively, fresh citrus aftertaste., 89.0, 29.0
US, , This is a very big, powerfully extracted Pinot Noir. It is not currently showing much varietal character. Feels like it was made by someone who knows how to make Cabernet, and brings that mindset to Pinot. The wine is full-bodied, thick, heavy and enormously concentrated in raspberries and cherries. Could change over time, but there's not much point in aging it., 86.0, 46.0
US, Fe Ciega Vineyard, This wine is as fine as anything from Santa Rita Hills. Although it's young and tight now, its future is assured by the brilliant combination of audacious fruit and classic structure. The blackberry, currant, cherry, anise and clove flavors are wrapped into rich, silky tannins, and brightened with crisp acidity. Best now, with decanting, and for the next 6–8 years., 96.0, 56.0
Italy, , This is a strange but enticing wine with an army of solid aromas that include apricot, dried peach, white stone, honey-nut and a fragrant pine forest-like element. You won't find many wines with this aromatic profile but you can't help but applaud its complex ensemble., 88.0, 38.0
Italy, , From the S. Angelo in Colle subzone of Montalcino, this seriously fruit-driven expression relies on a solid bouquet of cherry, blackberry and cassis. Oak-driven layers of spice and toast appear with more clarity in the mouth and the finish is capped by long, silky tannins. Drink after 2013., 91.0, 81.0
US, Four Boys Vineyard, Dry, but too ripe to the point of overripeness, with the cherry jam and chocolate flavors veering into Port, particularly on the finish, where a caramelized raisin taste dominates. Drink now., 85.0, 55.0
Italy, Electo Millesimato, Sweet notes of peppermint, exotic green herbs and yellow fruit come forward on the nose of this 80/20 sparkling blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Nero. The wine is simple and lean in the mouth with a crisp finish and tonic spice. Pair it with appetizers or fried finger foods., 87.0, 47.0
US, Faith, Deep blueberry, prune and dried purple aromas are made even more delicious by hints of bacon fat on this blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 30% Syrah, 9% Mourvèdre and 1% Grenache. The vintner lives in the historic Uvas Valley between Gilroy and Morgan Hill. Purple fruit juiciness is balanced by a sharp licorice edge, framed by judicious acidity and tannins., 89.0, 39.0
US, Hope's Cuvee Estate Grown and Bottled, A small-production barrel selection from the estate vineyard, this fine wine is brilliantly rich and balanced, proving that Napa Valley can produce excellent Chardonnay. With pineapple, lemon, lime and buttered toast flavors, it's ultraclean in acidity and vibrant in minerals. While it's quite dry, it finishes with a rich flourish of honey., 95.0, 65.0
South Africa, Gravel Hill, Beautiful, brooding and with a bit of an edge, the Gravel Hill starts with aromas of smoke, cloves, black currant and pepper, leading into a layered, savory array of rich spice and black fruit. Elegant but assertive, the wine has a distinctive South African character, with a touch of Old World minerality and restraint., 89.0, 139.0
Spain, Single Vineyard, Contino gives its single-vineyard Graciano all that it can, and still the wine, despite its deep purple color, is tight as a drum. There's juniper and blueberry on the nose, and then tangy blackberry flavors with an herbal slant. As varietal Graciano goes, this is nicely done. But it's up to you to decide if varietal Graciano is worth $147 a pop., 87.0, 147.0
France, , Thought by many tasters to be the wine of the vintage at the time of the 2004 barrel tastings. Has it retained that status? It is certainly a hugely powerful wine, monumental even. It is also finely balanced, with great dark tannins working in partnership with brooding black fruit. The question is whether it is too big, too powerful: only time will tell. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates., 95.0, 165.0
France, , The power of Corton-Charlemagne is apparent in this dense, ripe wine. Rich and generous, this selection has tropical fruit flavors that are balanced by citrus notes, and the wood influence acts as subtle support., 93.0, 173.0
Hungary, Essencia, Surprisingly subtle, yet maddeningly complex, this is a rare treat to unravel slowly, sip by sip. Sweet and honeyed on the nose with scents of freesia, orange peel and stone fruit, but accented with just a hint of sun-dried hay. The palate is deeply concentrated with undulating waves of honey, beeswax and fruit, but balanced with striking tangerine acidity. Remarkably long on the finish., 94.0, 764.0
US, Gianoli Vineyard, This shows a ripe and earthy flavor component, silky texture and lingering finish. It has aromas like flowers, leather and currants, then it offers black cherry, clove and cinnamon flavors, a rich mouthfeel and moderate tannins. Full bodied but smooth at the same time., 88.0, 48.0
France, Les Vaucrains Premier Cru, A fragrant wine, it offers truffle and red fruit aromas. The palate is ripe although it does have intense acidity, more bright red fruits than firmer structure. It feels almost ready to drink, fruity and fresh., 88.0, 148.0
US, Lowerre Family Estate, Sweet scents of milk chocolate and coffee accent the ripe red fruits on the nose of this Merlot-based Bordeaux-style blend. Dry and full bodied in style, the palate is awash in fresh ripe plums and cherries that linger pleasantly with a vibrant acidity and mouth-coating tannins., 86.0, 56.0
US, La Croce, This is the costliest of Stolpman's new reds and easily the best. It impresses for the depth of flavor and classic, dense structure. A co-fermented blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, it shows imposingly complex layers of dark stone fruits and berries, dark chocolate, bacon, dusty Indian spices and sweet, smoky sandalwood, wrapped into powerfully rich but gently ground tannins. Very fine, approaching the profound. Now–2013 before it loses freshness., 96.0, 66.0
Argentina, Pr1mum, Browning in color, with mounds of dry spice, tea and earth aromas, but also a cooked, overoaked quality that doesn't serve the wine well. The palate is plodding and doesn't really evolve, while flavors of brown sugar, obvious oak and roasted berry seem to be fading. Expensive for what's in the bottle., 84.0, 64.0
Spain, Reserva, Since coming into existence in 1988, this winery has made rich, modern reds that represent the best of what new-age Rioja is about. And the 2001 could be the best yet, as it offers aromas of rose petals, fresh lemon, cola, soy, coffee, leather and more. Definitely a powerhouse, with huge fruit from front to back. Lively in terms of tannins, with the expected monster oak. Employs 10% Graciano in addition to Tempranillo., 94.0, 74.0
Spain, Amancio, This single-vineyard beauty continues its run of excellence. The '07 is dense, toasty and powerful, with bacon, vanilla, cigar box and wild berry aromas that set up a strong-boned, fully structured palate overflowing with dark cherry, boysenberry, tobacco and sweet vanilla flavors. Needs time; drink from 2012 through 2022., 94.0, 174.0
US, Lewis Vineyard, You'll find ripe, sweet pineapple, peach and pear fruit in this wine, as well as crisp Carneros acidity. But the oak has been heavily applied, with overpowering buttered toast and caramel flavors., 87.0, 57.0
US, , Soft, peppery and a little on the sweet side, this Cab Franc has upfront flavors of cherry preserves. Rich tannins provide much-needed balance. Drink now., 85.0, 65.0
Australia, Exodus, A round, corpulent style of Chardonnay, nutty and rich but balanced by crisp apple and citrus notes. A bit of Eden Valley Riesling provides the wine's freshness., 88.0, 58.0
Italy, Riserva, Loacker/Corte Pavone is on a roll of late and is making some of the finest Brunello you will find. Organic farming practices have helped shape a truly tremendous wine with deep concentration and amazing intensity. The wine is rich and velvety and bursting with bright fruit nuances. Drink after 2015., 95.0, 75.0
US, Cuvée Julia, Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, this bombastic blend also has Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petite Sirah. A bouquet of cinnamon and clove invites, before intense tar, tobacco and bittersweet tannins make way for super-sized oak and a taste of bacon., 85.0, 165.0
US, HaLo, Trefethen has been on a roll the last few years, producing some of Napa's most spectacular Cabernets. This bottling, which contains minor quantities of Petit Verdot and Merlot, spent 28 months in new French oak barrels. The fruit is incredibly ripe and intense, with flavors of black currants and chocolate-covered cherries. As hard as the tannins are, they must have been even more aggressive two or three years ago, so kudos to Trefethen for holding the bottle back for five years. This beauty is just now beginning its long journey. Drink now–2020., 95.0, 175.0
US, CV Reserve, Ripe strawberry pie and cigar box aromas frame the nose on this top-end offering from Broken Earth. It's surprisingly light on the palate, with cherry pie and cranberry tartness leading the way alongside bright acidity and dainty tannins., 89.0, 59.0
Italy, Redigaffi, This wine is at the top of its class in a new generation of super Tuscan producers. Plush and velvety, it opens with rich aromas of chocolate, cherry, peppercorn, black fruit and cola. Thick extraction sets the tone for a lush wine that requires a few more years in the bottle: Drink after 2012., 95.0, 275.0
Australia, Aphrodite, A manageable 14.5% alcohol, Two Hands' flagship Cab has dark aromas with a ribbon of raspberry jam running through them. The palate is heavy on bitter chocolate and wood, again, with lifted red fruit peeking through. This is a very good wine overall, but not one that's long enough, or deep enough, to reach that next level., 89.0, 159.0
Germany, Zeltinger Sonnenuhr Auslese, Sweet, rich and soft, this is a nice wine, but in the context of site, producer and vintage, a bit of a disappointment. Honey and clove flavors lack extra dimensions of complexity and focus, finishing without the expected balancing zing of acidity., 86.0, 66.0
Portugal, Vintage, A solidly structured wine, packed with initially sweet fruit that then becomes drier as the ripe tannins show through. All the ingredients are there, supported by a tense texture to go with the first sweetness. It's an exciting wine, obviously very ageworthy., 96.0, 76.0
France, Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru, With his family based in Puligny-Montrachet, Olivier Leflaive knows a thing or two about the grand crus of his village. This Bâtard-Montrachet is intensely textured, concentrated and ripe, and it exudes equal amounts of acids. Powerful yet elegant, the toast note is a subtle expression in this rich wine. This for long-term aging., 95.0, 375.0
France, , The small Mazoyères-Chambertin Grand Cru creates structured wines with plenty of texture and tannins. This is brooding, firm and very concentrated, with its fruit set way behind the dark tannins and spice note. It will take at least 10 years to start to mature., 95.0, 475.0
Italy, Cignale, Cignale, or wild boar is one of Tuscany's best expressions of Cabernet Sauvignon. A small percentage of   Merlot is added for softness and flavor and the wine oozes darkness, blackberry and exotic spice at its core. Pair it with game meat or spicy pork sausage., 93.0, 83.0
Spain, Malleolus de Sanchomartin, Richer and more grapey than the Valdorramiro 2008, but also friendlier, deeper and more complete. Aromas of blackberry, vanilla and sweet spices lead to a structured, weighty palate full of spicy, oak-driven berry and plum flavors. Clove notes and length define the finish. Drink from 2014–2019, 93.0, 183.0
Spain, Miserere, Generally speaking, this is a respectable Priorat from a tough year. The nose is berry packed, while the flavors run toward toast-covered raspberry. It's typically grabby and expansive, as any good young wine from the area will be, yet you can drink it now with meat., 88.0, 68.0
Germany, Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese, Dusty earth and mineral tones lend contrast to sweet, sunny tangerine and caramel in this feather-light TBA. The palate is persistent and pristine, awash in stone fruit flavors that pierce with laser-like brilliance. Delectable now for it's youth and fruitiness, but likely to develop mineral complexities for decades to come., 95.0, 775.0
Italy, Bussia, Aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, eucalyptus, mature berry and dark spice lead the nose. There's not a lot of fruit richness but the spicy palate offers licorice, black pepper and sage alongside grippy tannins that leave a firm, drying finish., 89.0, 69.0
US, Viking Estate Reserve, Made in the old-fashioned Paso style, which is soft and overtly sweet. The cherry, currant, chocolate, anise and spice flavors are delicious, but the wine needs to be drier and better structured., 85.0, 75.0
US, , This rich wine is a great success. It's enormously rich, almost flamboyant in blackberry jam, blueberry cobbler, anise and smoky new oak, as delicious as any Cabernet out there. Yet it shows a fine structure and relatively modest alcohol, a feature of the 2008 vintage. Good as it is now, you can safely cellar it for the rest of this decade and watch it evolve., 95.0, 85.0
France, Cuvée Palmes d'Or Brut Rosé, Quite red in color and a tad unusual. The nose has rhubarb, berry and beet, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like raspberry. Bubbly on the finish. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports., 85.0, 175.0
Australia, Les Amis, This rich, opulent wine carries its massive oak load easily, marrying vanilla and toasted coconut notes with ripe plum and black cherry flavors. It's full bodied and plush, with supple tannins supported by the wood. Give it a few years to knit together and drink it 2020–2030., 95.0, 185.0
Italy, Söri Rio Sordo, Having heard some promising buzz about the 2001 vintage, this wine—one of the first 2001 Barbarescos tasted—was a bit of a disappointment. The mint, citrus and rhubarb aromas do open up and gain some chocolaty richness with air, but the finish remains tart, crisp and astringent., 86.0, 76.0
France, Grand Cru Heimbourg Turckheim Vendange Tardive, It may be vendange tardive, but the sweetness is the least of this wine's qualities. It is more to do with how it relates to the terroir of the Heimbourg vineyard, with its mineral character, and its fine structure and texture. The fruit is still young, and would benefit from 5–10 years aging., 96.0, 86.0
Hungary, Solus, A spicy, gamy nose of cloves and red berry lead on this impressive Merlot, and on the palate, it's assertive but smooth, with spicy smoke and clove waves and a slightly tart berry character. Substantial tannin means it can age and be paired with more robust meat dishes., 87.0, 77.0
France, , One of the jewels of Domaine Faively,  this wine is huge, rich and structured. It has power and concentrated tannins, and the hints of wood aging are apparent. The ripeness of the fruit and the serious texture promise long-term aging., 95.0, 385.0
Italy, Batàr, Yellow in color, which announces richness and weight to come. Aromas of lemon curd, orange and vanilla are nice, while the melon and honey flavors are soft. Interesting and stylish, but low in acid courtesy of a blazing vintage. Drink this Chard-Pinot Bianco blend now., 88.0, 78.0
Italy, Brunate, Warm and robust, this full-bodied Barolo offers aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, tar and kirsch. The palate is bold and hearty but also shows the heat of the vintage, doling out cherry-marinated-in-spirits, licorice and clove alongside almost scorching alcohol. Drink sooner rather than later., 89.0, 79.0
Italy, , Duemani is known for its high quality organic and biodynamic wines from Tuscany. This hearty expression of Cab Franc shows wonderful intensity with dark aromas of blackberry, black cherry, crushed pepper and polished river stone. The wine is firm and and focused with finely textured tannins., 90.0, 90.0
France, Clos des Cortons, One of Faiveley's monopoles (wholly owned vineyards), Clos des Cortons makes powerful wines. That's the case in 2005. This wine towers up, a strong edifice of tannins and big, black fruits. It has all the right elements coming into place, along with weight and some elegance., 95.0, 195.0
Spain, Aro, Plant-by-plant fruit selection leads to intensity, concentration and structure. Aro shows gripping tannins and juicy acidity, and overall it reeks of power and precision. At this young stage it seems like it could last forever. In reality, it should be just right in about seven years. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc., 94.0, 194.0
France, , A gorgeously perfumed wine, dominated by the ripest Cabernet Franc, combining richness and an intense structure. With its tannins, it will age well over many years. The fruit is finely textured, deliciously juicy, showing the most complex series of flavors., 95.0, 295.0
France, , Big, ripe and fruity, it combines a rich character along with the firmest tannins and dense structure. Acidity adds a touch of freshness, while the structure and full fruit are concentrated and still young. Give this solid, dark wine at least until 2020., 94.0, 294.0
Spain, Pesus, Talk about a wine that's tight as a bank vault. You almost need a pick and axe to get into this bruiser. The bouquet is drawn in, with toast, lemon peel and pure belt leather adding a manly element to the earthy fruit that lurks below. What a pedigree on this single-vineyard alta expressión red, and the coffee-flooded finish goes on and on. Hold until 2009. 125 cases made., 95.0, 395.0
Italy, Costa Russi, Costa Russi presents a dark wall of ripe fruit and an exotic spice shading that give momentum and power to the finish. There are also notes of plum, dark chocolate, tobacco, licorice and tar. The quality of the tannins is firm and polished; this should evolve over many years to come., 95.0, 495.0
France, Marquis de Laguiche, This is a beautifully shaped wine that rises from a quiet opening. Muted and slightly closed up at this stage, it opens opulently but with balanced acidity and crispness, as well as richness and restrained power., 96.0, 596.0
Italy, Helichrysum, Aromas of forest floor, new leather, cherries marinated in spirits, crushed violet and menthol open on the nose. On the warm, one-dimensional palate, tightly wound tannins frame ripe black cherry and baking spice. Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink., 89.0, 99.0
US, Isoceles Reserve, A very rich wine—this has a warm, soft mouthfeel and ripe, jammy flavors enhanced with oak. Except for the heat, it's a lovely wine. Drink now., 88.0, 98.0
France, Cave Privée Brut, This toasty, superbly mature wine is part of a series of releases featuring the house's cellar-matured Champagnes. This emerges from the glass with complex flavors of almond, brioche, citrus and a hint of steeliness. The majestic richness of the wine has fully justified its decades of aging., 97.0, 208.0
Spain, Inspiración Valdemar, Intense and frisky, with mild green-herbal aromas standing out on the nose. Like any varietal Graciano, the wine is shrill, with acidity pushing the tart side of the huckleberry and blueberry fruit. Lean at the end, with little richness. Best for die-hard Rioja buffs and fans of acidic red wines., 85.0, 95.0
US, Estate Bottled Reserve, The vintage was a good one for Peju, resulting in wines that bear the winery's distinctive style of balanced elegance. This reserve is very ripe and flamboyant in blackberry and black currant flavors, with an opulent overlay of toasty oak. This is so delicious that it tastes like there's a squirt of milk chocolate in it, but the wine is, in fact, thoroughly dry., 94.0, 105.0
France, Lasira Red Wine, The new VF line from Beaucastel's Perrin family is a stunning statement of affordable quality. Screw-capped and plainly packaged, Lasira delivers the goods where it counts: in the bottle. The blend is three-quarters Syrah, one-quarter Grenache, and as the label points out, 0% cork. Bright, spicy and showing sharp berry flavors, this fruit and acid-driven bottling is a classy new wine for a new generation of wine drinkers., 88.0, 9.0
Spain, Malleolus de Sanchomartin, Another winner from Emilio Moro. The nose is a touch minty and very spicy, but the black fruit element is there and overall the bouquet sings of integration. Pure, enthralling and big, with monster black fruit flavors, complexity, rich oak and a long, smooth finish. Stylish yet powerful; drink from 2013 through 2020., 94.0, 205.0
US, Two Vines, Consistently fine, this sweet/tart, juicy and mouth-filling Riesling mixes plush stone fruits, green apple and melon, streaked with honey and orange peel. The 3.5% residual sugar is nicely matched with crisp acids., 87.0, 8.0
France, , A beautiful wine, smooth, polished, with rounded corners. Its intense fruit is balanced and harmonizes well with the sweet tannins, the layers of wood and the red berry flavors. Certainly powerful, it impresses equally with the pleasure it will give in 7–10 years., 98.0, 319.0
France, , A finely balanced wine, with the acidity a pure streak through the white pear and lime flavors. The wine is rich, the wood so carefully judged with the beautiful fruit., 93.0, 104.0
Portugal, Bucellas Arinto, The brand Bucellas (with two “l”s) has been made by Caves Velhas for years. It remains a light, fresh, crisp wine, all white berry fruits, green plums and lively acidity. A great seafood wine., 86.0, 7.0
Germany, Abtsberg Beerenauslese, For a beerenauslese, usually dominated by honeyed fruit, this shows a surprising degree of stony minerality, which helps to balance the rich, sweet flavors of orange marmalade, dried apricots and honey. Viscous in texture, yet the citrus and mineral notes keep it from becoming cloying. Drink now–2035., 93.0, 204.0
Germany, Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett, This medium-bodied kabinett features an appealing lushness to its texture—it's not a slim, racy wine but instead offers hints of honey and diesel oil balanced by ripe apples and citrus. Drink now., 88.0, 19.0
Italy, Tegole, Here's a thin, lean and easy-to-drink Sangiovese with a pretty aromatic ensemble of spice, blueberry and roasted nut., 85.0, 6.0
France, , A rich and opulent wine, very ripe, packed with luscious blackberry and damson fruit as well as sweet tannins. It is a fruit salad of fruit flavors given structure by a core of dryness. Already a gorgeous wine, but one that will also age., 95.0, 116.0
France, Les Folatières Premier Cru, Still tasting young, and not yet showing all its power, this is still an impressive wine. It is firm and structured, with citrus and mineral flavors dominating the concentrated fruit. The wood shows through via a warm spiciness. This will certainly age for 5 years or more., 92.0, 103.0
US, Turner Vineyard, Ripe and crisp in acidity, this 100% Pinot Gris comes from a single vineyard in this highly regarded Santa Barbara County appellation. The wine never saw oak, so the pineapple, apple butter, mango and vanilla flavors come entirely from the grapes., 87.0, 18.0
Spain, Cardenal Cisneros Reservas, This reserve-level P.X. sets the gold standard for excellence in sweet sherry. The lovely bouquet straddles the line between unadulterated sweetness and impeccable slyness. The flavors of fig, chocolate, caramel, browned butter and cinnamon are amazing. So chewy and thick, but balanced by firm acids. Brilliant., 94.0, 15.0
US, Twin Valley, When I was getting into wine, Gallo's inexpensive Sauvignon Blanc was my house white. The wine hasn't changed at all over the years, and still offers plenty of polished citrus, melon and fig flavors in a dry, clean package., 84.0, 5.0
US, Private Reserve, This is an awesome wine that's rich and dramatically layered, with smooth Oakville tannins and a fine jacket of acidity. It's upfront and concentrated, calling attention to its layers of blackberry, cassis, mocha, anise and sweet oak. Beautiful now, but it will continue to develop additional complexities over the next 10 years. Spoto has dramatically upped its game with this release., 94.0, 115.0
Italy, , This stunning Chianti Classico has an intense perfume of violet, rose and iris, accented with scents of truffle and forest berry. The wildly delicious palate presents a core of juicy cherry layered with sweet pipe tobacco, mint and spice, with a hint of well-integrated oak. It has great energy, with vibrant acidity and bracing but refined tannins. Drink 2016–2025., 96.0, 27.0
US, , This is a ripely fruity wine with a dollop of French oak that's a textbook example of Lodi. Soft in acids, with powerful tropical fruit, nectarine, peach, pear and apple flavors, it offers clean, easy drinking., 86.0, 17.0
France, Clos des Cortons Faiveley, It's rare in Burgundy that a producer can add his name to a vineyard, but Faiveley's tradition goes back at least a century. This is huge and dense; the notes of spice, sweet black plum and acidity are all comfortably balanced with the powerful tannic structure. This needs at least seven years of aging., 94.0, 215.0
US, , Huge, ripe flavors of blackberry and plum jam, mocha, black currants, anise and cedar mark this wine, grown in the rugged hills of southern Monterey County. It's quite tannic and dry, but doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink up., 88.0, 29.0
Italy, Sassicaia, Sassicaia has been showing amazing results in recent years, and the 2009 vintage opens with all the intensity and beauty you should expect of Italy's flagship super Tuscan. Notes of blackberry, soft spice, chocolate, espresso and a touch of rosemary oil make for a beautiful bouquet. The mouthfeel is long, supple and rich. Drink after 2020., 96.0, 227.0
France, , Heavy and glowering, this wine is powered with weight. The fruit is an afterthought, the white currants, green plums and acidity creeping in after all the density of structure has softened. Wood to finish., 88.0, 129.0
US, , Massive, opulent, oozing in pineapple créme brulée, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Totally decadent, and fortunately set off with brisk, citrusy acidity. Calling all lobsters, and don't forget the drawn butter. Sheer hedonism in a glass, at a fantastic price., 95.0, 26.0
US, , Arista's basic Pinot, which contains some Anderson Valley fruit, is textbook cool-climate Pinot, very dry and quite acidic. It's a little diluted, but enjoyable for its cherry, cola and toast flavors that finish in a great burst of peppery spice., 87.0, 28.0
US, , The aromas of fresh cut apples are so strong that this could easily pass for apple cider in a blind tasting. It's low alcohol, high acid, and quite unusual., 85.0, 16.0
US, Private Reserve, There's good structure to this Cabernet, thanks to the firm tannins and ample acidity. But the flavors take the starring role, with raspberries, cherries, currants, mocha and cedar. It has a light, delicate mouthfeel, although there's nothing light about the taste. It's complex and ageable, so give it until 2020 to begin to come around., 95.0, 126.0
US, Unoaked, Sweet and fruity, this canned wine feels soft and syrupy, with sugary pear as the primary flavor on the palate. It's a basic white wine in a convenient package., 83.0, 4.0
France, Perrières Premier Cru, You can smell the chalky soil on this wine. It has some of the Meursault richness propped by wood, but it is also tight, mineral, a crisp citrus-dominated wine, the fresh apple skins giving it a vivid texture., 93.0, 114.0
France, , A big, rounded wine that brings in power, concentration and weight. Perhaps too much weight: a huge mouthful of fruit and tannins. It really needs many years to come together with all this punch and rich texture., 93.0, 214.0
US, , Give this wine credit for the sheer power of its fruit. Swamps the palate with freshly crushed raspberry and cherry flavors, liberally enriched with sweet vanilla and caramelized oak. Other than that, it's a bit soft and one-dimensional, but the score reflects how delicious it is., 88.0, 39.0
France, Gouttes d'Or Premier Cru, Very pure lemon and toast flavors dominate this wine. It has crispness, intense freshness and lively acidity. There is also a sense of richness that is slowly developing and that will broaden the wine over the next several months., 91.0, 102.0
Italy, Corte Colombara, Slightly closed and neutral at the start, give this wine a few minutes to open up. It will reveal tones of red forest berry, cedar wood, spice and tobacco. It has a sharp feel in the mouth with sour cherry flavors on the finish. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd., 86.0, 27.0
US, Lone Redwood Ranch, Dry and distinctly wild in brambly, briary berry fruit and spice. At first this Zin feels rustic, with a sandpapery grip and fresh, juicy acids. But the brilliant structure of acidity, bracing tannins and caressing mouthfeel reveal how delicate this really is. This is great Zinfandel., 94.0, 25.0
Chile, Gran Reserva, Opens with fiery cherry-berry aromas and then some mossy dankness. The palate is tight and snappy, with basic berry flavors and then a blast of burnt toast and herbal notes. Incongruent in its mix of acid-based feel and flavors along with herbal, heavier characteristics., 84.0, 15.0
Italy, Cannubi, A Barolo superstar on the rise—keep a close watch on the wines of Gianni Gagliardo and family. This expression from the prized Cannubi cru offers impressive intensity and personality with enticing aromas of black fruit, cola, root beer, cured beef, cedar and white truffle. The wine is ethereal and elegant but the tannic touch is firm enough to promise a long cellar future ahead., 94.0, 125.0
Italy, Osa! Frappato Rosato, This rosé opens with a pretty shade of pink and offers aromas of forest berry, cherry, herbs and a touch of ash or white mineral. There's firm, crisp acidity that really keeps the palate refreshed. Shows loads of cheer and brightness in the mouth., 87.0, 38.0
US, Insignia, You have to count this as another great Insignia, dry and complex and ageworthy, although the tannins are fierce now, and it may lack just a bit of the glamor of, say, the 2004 or 2001. It's certainly a big wine that floods the mouth with blackberry, black currant, cassis and new oak flavors. The tannins and acids make it aloof, resistant, tough. It wants time in the cellar. Best after 2013. Production was a hefty 13,500 cases., 94.0, 225.0
Germany, Hecklinger Schlossberg R GG Trocken, Initial waves of charred oak and smoke impose against a delicate backdrop of black cherry and bramble, but fruity and herbaceous green flavors come through nicely on the midpalate, layered with hints of earthy mushrooms and dusty minerals., 87.0, 138.0
Italy, Solaia, Aromas of baked dark-skinned fruit, cedar, cooking spice and a balsamic note unfold in the glass. A blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Sangiovese, and 5% Cabernet Franc, the firmly structured palate delivers ripe black currants, dried black cherries, clove, mint, tobacco and anise alongside tightly woven but fine-grained tannins. Give this time to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2017–2023., 94.0, 325.0
US, Chaleur Estate Blanc, Consistent year after year, this blend of 67% Sauvignon Blanc and 33% Sémillon is modeled after top-flight white Bordeaux. Deep gold, toasty and scented with olive oil, walnuts and loam, it hits the palate full-on with a rainbow of flavors: citrus, stone and tropical fruits, all accented with toast, oil and nuts from barrel aging. Riveting, delicious  and unique., 95.0, 36.0
US, Suacci Vineyard, High in acidity, this single-vineyard Pinot stings the palate with tartness. Yet it's packed with rich currant, persimmon and Dr. Pepper flavors, and is dry and moderate in alcohol. Although this winery has little history, the wine may develop bottle elegance. Try after 2009., 88.0, 49.0
US, , Medium-bodied and supple in texture, this dark and brambly Virginian Merlot offers plenty of black fruit and warm, savory spices. Aged in a combination of American and Hungarian oak, there's a slightly reedy, wooden note and high-toned acidity on the finish., 85.0, 26.0
Italy, Maria di Brun, An enticing fragrance of rose, blue flower, incense and truffle wafts out of the glass. On the palate, accents of black pepper, espresso and licorice add depth to the bright cherry-berry fruit, while polished tannins give it a smooth, silky texture. It's well balanced and fresh. Drink 2018–2030., 92.0, 113.0
France, Huebuhl, A wine packed with noble rot, giving richness rather than sweetness. An intoxicating blend of smokiness and almonds mixes with flavors of citrus zest and toast in this complex, concentrated wine. From the tiny Huebuhl vineyard in Bergheim. Impressive. Imported by Lauber Imports., 96.0, 47.0
Italy, , A rich, ripe expression of one of Italy's iconic wines, this displays the heat of the 2011 vintage. It opens with aromas of red currants, tobacco, oak and exotic spice while the full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherries, blueberry extract, licorice and black pepper. Densely concentrated and tightly packed with assertive but fine-grained tannins, you'll need to give this time to unwind. Drink 2017–2026., 94.0, 625.0
Chile, Rapsodia, Floral smelling but also leafy and rubbery, with an overriding set of cheesy, leathery aromas. It's crisp, tart and acidic in the mouth, with lean, generic red plum, aged cheese and vanilla flavors. Medium in weight, with choppy crispness to finish. Imported by GOS Wines and BMC Imports., 86.0, 37.0
US, Estate, This gorgeous new release, from a young winery with a Riesling focus, is resplendent with an enticing mix of flowers, fruits and stone. The scents well up from the glass and the flavors fill the mouth with a lively zest, pulling together streaks of lemon, lime, nectarine and apricot, accented with citrus rind and wet rock, honey and lemon tea., 93.0, 24.0
US, Westside Road Neighbors, Seductively smooth and intriguingly aromatic, this blend of several knock-out vineyards along Westside Road—Allen, Bacigalupi, Bucher, Rochioli Riverblock and Williams Selyem Estate—is instantly delicious, sharing a concentration of cherry, strawberry and citrus that perfectly captures the essence of the fruit, accented by a tease of black tea. An earthy minerality wraps around dry, polished tannins, with a streak of just-right acidity, giving it a realm of juiciness and flavorful sophistication. Enjoy through 2023., 98.0, 69.0
Argentina, Carrascal, Bland and chunky, with aromas of talcum powder and apple. The palate feel is a mix of spritz and heft, and the flavors of melon and peach are pithy and lean toward bitter. Dusty and heavy on the finish, an indication that it won't last long and has already seen better days., 83.0, 14.0
France, Aux Boudots Premier Cru, Made from 60-year-old vines from a property next door to Vosne-Romanée, this wine is both structured and rich. It has dark tannins, with juicy and jammy plum fruits that are layered with acidity. It is still firm, dense and needs time. Drink from 2020., 93.0, 124.0
US, Party of Four Estate Grown, This Bordeaux blend, based on equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is softly opulent and ripe, in the way of many Paso Robles red wines. It floods the mouth with blackberries and currants, with spicy complexities from oak, and is fairly tannic, although not so much that a good steak won't cut through it. Best Now–2012., 88.0, 59.0
France, , This is a firm, toasty and tannic wine that reflects its tough vintage. Made from 100% Merlot it has ripe fruit that was aged for two years in wood to give that spicy woody character. The fruit still needs time to enhance the rich texture of the wine. Drink from 2020., 88.0, 159.0
US, , Quite a distinguished Cabernet. Shows its pedigree in ultra-refined tannins and an overall mouthfeel of lushness and finesse. Flavor-wise, it's all black currants, blueberries and sweet, smoky oak. Thirty-five dollars isn't cheap, but this is as good as it gets in this price bracket., 94.0, 35.0
US, Red Label, This is a sweet, oaky, simple Chardonnay. It's forward in ripe pineapple, orange and melon fruit flavors, with a honeyed finish., 84.0, 25.0
France, , Don't be fooled by the easy fruitiness of this delicious wine, because underneath the blackberry flavors is a powerfully tannic structure. Opulent and dense, it promises considerable aging. Drink this complex wine from 2018., 94.0, 135.0
Portugal, , The legendary Mouchão, one of Portugal's most revered wines, has finally made it to this country. Made in traditional open stone fermenters, this is not a modern wine. It's a wine, whose dark tannins and dense fruits demand attention and time. At this stage—six years in—it remains a baby, but in another five years, it will start to be a great wine, one that will show a hedonistic mix of power and beauty., 95.0, 46.0
US, Reserve, An ambitious wine that doesn't live up to its reserve status. Most of the parts are here, from the ripe tannins and fine acidity to the moderate alcohol and toasty oak, but the currant flavors finish too thin for ageability, or to justify the price., 84.0, 125.0
France, , The high toast aromas, typical of Chanson wines, can be off-putting. But get beyond the wood, which needs a couple more years to integrate, and the ripe fruit of 2005 gives this wine density and character. The yellow fruits, ripe cantaloupe melon flavor and sweet acidity will more than hold their own against the wood., 94.0, 235.0
US, , Soft and fruity, this Zin is so filled with raspberries, cherries, carob and oak, it's almost sweet. It's a one-dimensional but lusty wine that's easy to drink with grilled meats and poultry., 85.0, 36.0
France, Les Bessards, Incredibly rich, velvety-textured and long, this is a great example of Hermitage from a superripe vintage. It's dense like fruitcake without being excessively heavy, and boasts such a panopoly of nuance as to be spellbinding, ranging from spice and herb to black olive and espresso. Wow! Drink now–2025., 95.0, 146.0
US, Klopp Ranch, Made in the Merry Edwards style, which is powerfully ripe and extracted, yet always balanced. Dazzles with enormous cherry pie filling, cola, sassafras, beef jerky, raspberry tart, anise, pepper and smoky cedar flavors that finish with amazing length. Yet the tannin-acid structure is superb, and the wine is totally dry. Beautiful now, and should age through 2012., 96.0, 57.0
US, , A disappointing wine. Tastes frankly unripe, with a vegetal undertow to the blackberries and cherries. The thinness of fruit accentuates the alcohol which, although only 14.6%, comes through as hot. The grapes came from the cool Coombsville area, and the wine is 100% Cabernet., 84.0, 225.0
US, , Already entering its maturity, this offers flavors of dried cherries, cherry tobacco and rather tough, chewy tannins. It seems to have a hole in the midpalate, and may be moving quickly past its prime. Drink up., 86.0, 47.0
US, Père de Famille, As good as any Père de Famille to date, this brilliantly crafted wine jumps from the glass immediately with a rainbow of blue, purple and black fruits. The scents and flavors are dense and seamless, the tannins polished and graceful, and the barrel aging puts the last dabs of paint on a winemaking masterpiece., 97.0, 68.0
US, , This is Goldeneye's basic appellation Pinot. It's fairly rich in cherries, raspberries, cola, red currant, licorice and sandalwood, with an elegantly crisp mouthfeel. But it lacks excitement, especially at this price. Drink now., 87.0, 58.0
Italy, Where Dreams Have No End, Toasted oak, hazelnut and fresh herb aromas carry over to the lean, linear palate, along with lemon drop, yellow apple and a confected notes. Crisp acidity lends a racy elegance., 88.0, 69.0
Germany, Casteller Schlossberg Beerenauslese, This is a broad, sweet, full-bodied dessert wine that lacks the crisp acids necessary for a higher degree of balance. Instead, it delivers intense honey and pineapple flavors that stick stubbornly to the palate. Probably best with sweet desserts., 88.0, 169.0
France, , This wine is perfumed with gorgeous fruit that contrasts with the strict minerality. The tannins under the fruit are severe, solid, dark and promising enormous potential. Concentrated even while it celebrates great fruit, it is going to last for many years. Drink from 2023., 97.0, 468.0
US, Allen Vineyard, Not showing well now due to the tannins. It's dry and tough, with a resistance to the richness. Yet the core of flavor is enormous. Shows concentrated, flashy flavors of cherry marmalade, raspberry, orange blossom, cola, licorice, rose tea and spices that go on and on and continue to develop in the glass. The texture is pure silk and satin. Needs 4–6 years to develop, and could go beyond that., 97.0, 78.0
US, Flax Vineyard, A sip is all it takes to fall in love with this potent Pinot Noir. Big tannins and crisp acidity make it hard to appreciate now, but there's a gigantic core of cherries and raspberries, with a firm minerality from the soil. Will develop bottle complexity over the years. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015., 95.0, 56.0
US, Stoneridge Vineyard, This is pure Cabernet—tight, tannic and terroir-driven. It has a dense mix of fruit, rock, earth and herb flavors that are nicely integrated, with a full palate and fine complexity and density. A little more barrel toast would put the icing on the cake., 94.0, 45.0
Italy, Vigna Camarato Riserva, Made from 80% Aglianico and 20% Piedirosso, this opens with aromas of new oak, earth, leather and a funky hint of game. The palate offers blackberry, wild cherry, licorice and eucalyptus alongside aggressive, tightly knit tannins that need time to unwind and soften. Drink after 2017., 88.0, 79.0
France, Furstentum Grand Cru, Rich, full bodied and medium dry, it is powered by ripe fruits, lychees and pomegranates. A spicy undertow brings along some acidity to this concentrated wine. Drink from 2016., 93.0, 34.0
France, Cristal Brut, This is an exceptional wine, as is the vintage. The fruits—grapefruit, crisp red apple—balance with a fine yeasty character. There is a great depth of flavor, the fruits going in a pure line of freshness. The one problem is that it is much too young, the result of the demand from the market for the next vintage. Age this wine for at least four years., 98.0, 289.0
US, Reserve, Dry and tough in tannins, this Merlot is relieved with some good cherry, blackberry, cocoa, tobacco and oak flavors. The astringency doesn't seem likely to age out., 85.0, 46.0
France, Clavoillon Premier Cru, At this stage, the wine is closed up, the fruit quite tight. But it is extremely rich, the potential from the spice, broad white fruits and intense minerality all promising good aging., 94.0, 145.0
US, , A heavy cloak of oak can't hide the high alcohol level (15%). Sure, the alcohol provides weight and texture, but also heat on the finish. The black cherry and black pepper flavors need some time to smooth the rough edges, but then the alcohol will likely become more prominent. Drink young for its rustic ebullience, with rare beef to help tame the tannins., 84.0, 35.0
France, , There is such elegance on this concentrated wine, combining richness with intense structure. A blend of yellow fruit, crisp apple and lemon zest flavors surface on this opulent, balanced and structured effort. This is meant for long-term aging., 95.0, 256.0
France, Fonteny, Still youthful, this traditional wine from a great Burgundy vintage is showing fine vigor, ripe fruits and firm tannins. It has spice and is almost honeyed in its sweetness, with plums and intense, mature acidity. With its firm core, give this wine several more years of aging., 93.0, 134.0
US, , This Albariño is a pretty little wine and refreshingly different. There's subtle white flowers and quince upfront, followed by a light-bodied but intensely perfumed palate. While the mouth is a bit soft, this wine ends with a refreshing kick of acid. Try with light fish dishes., 83.0, 24.0
US, Yountville Selection, Grgich has struggled with this uneven bottling over the years, and the 2003 shows the problems that have plagued the wine. It combines sharpness with sugary cherry-berry flavors, making for a sweet and sour taste. There are tannins aplenty, but it doesn't seem like an ager., 84.0, 135.0
France, Les Cazetiers Premier Cru, This finely made wine has weight and firm tannins, along with intense acidity. Faiveley owns 12 acres of this premier cru which produces structured wines with fruit tannins and smoky fruit. At the end, the wood aging gives a burnt edge that needs to soften. Drink from 2017., 92.0, 123.0
US, , Okay for everyday purposes, if you're at a party sipping the house wine from a paper cup. Dry and rugged, with blackberry and cherry flavors and a sharp finish., 82.0, 13.0
France, L'Ermite Ermitage, The 2006 L'Ermite boasts a wonderfully fragrant bouquet of cracked pepper, beef blood and plummy fruit, but is a full-bodied, powerful expression of Syrah on the mouth, bulging with crushed stone and espresso nuances. It's velvety without being soft, the tannins showing supple strength. Drink 2015–2030., 94.0, 345.0
Italy, Costa Russi, Costa Russi (a vineyard purchased by Gaja in 1967) produces a feminine wine with an emphasis on elegance and harmony, rather than power and succulence. Bright red fruit, smoke, cedar, cola and polished mineral notes create a beautiful embroidery of aromas and the wine's firm but composed tannins bring the mouth alive. Keep it in your cellar 10 years or more., 94.0, 445.0
Argentina, Finca Altamira, Achaval's Uco Valley single-vineyard Malbec is strapping and minerally, with exotic black-fruit aromas darkened up by road tar but lightened by violets. It's focused and bright, with juicy cherry and black-plum flavors. Pure and direct, with a long finish. Drink now through 2013., 91.0, 112.0
France, , A tropical- fruited wine, full of toast and apricot and melon fruits. It is deliciously ripe and soft with the acidity lost in the richness. It is opulent and already a pleasure to drink., 94.0, 545.0
US, , This is the best bottling of a very fine lineup from Leonetti. Dense, textural and complex, it showcases exceptional blending of flavors from the addition of just 7% Merlot, 4% Carmenère and 1% Malbec. Notes of plum, cassis, coffee grounds, dark chocolate and a hint of herb run through a complete and engaging finish, retaining both elegance and power., 97.0, 88.0
France, Chaillot, From the domaine's young vines, this offering features somewhat restrained aromatics, with just traces of violets and blackberries. But on the palate there's plenty of cassis fruit. No, it's not that rich or lush, but it's pure, supple and easy to drink right out of the gate. Drink now–2012., 87.0, 78.0
France, , Packed with tannins and boasting an enormous structure, this wine is opulent while very firm. At the same time, smoky acidity shoots through all this density. From a great terroir, this wine shows minerality and its great structure well. Drink from 2023., 97.0, 288.0
Italy, Sapaio, Not bad for a first attempt. This is a thick, dark wine of almost impenetrable extraction and mature fruit notes of black cherry and black currant. Its aromas are painted in broad brush strokes and invoke roasted espresso bean, black chocolate and smoked game. It has an outstanding mouthfeel, with voluptuous but solid tannins and enormous length. Drink after 2015., 95.0, 66.0
US, , Tannicly dry, this Merlot has a tough chewiness that makes it hard to appreciate the ripe cherry, blackberry, licorice and cocoa flavors. Could soften with a few years, but not a wine for the long haul., 85.0, 56.0
US, Haynes Old Block, From a cool part of the Napa Valley, this wine is bright and medium bodied—a moderately oaked mix of lemon custard, floral citrus and green apple flavors with an underlying spark of lemongrass and ginger. Richly layered, it remains balanced and structured as it opens in the glass., 94.0, 55.0
Italy, Le Vigne, The Le Vigne cru from Luciano Sandrone delivers focused aromas of wild cherries, white almond, cola and light shadings of sweet spice. The texture is drying and firm and the wine excels in the mouth thanks to the tight and supple feel of its tannins. Pair this delicious wine with lamb, pork or beef., 94.0, 155.0
Italy, Boiolo, This Barolo has a somewhat raw quality, delivering sensations of tart red cherry, black pepper, sage, coffee bean and bitter chocolate. The bracing tannins are astringent and overpowering at this stage. Try it after 2020., 88.0, 99.0
France, , A subsidiary label of Chateau Gruaud Larose, obviously destined for earlier drinking than the grand vin. Supple tannins frame cedar, tobacco and earth notes, while the light frame holds just enough flesh to avoid leanness., 84.0, 45.0
Italy, Sperss, Sperss is a vineyard located in the Serralunga area (Nebbiolo with 6% Barbera) that delivers pristine aromas of wild berry, anise, sweet spice, licorice and Spanish cedar. Oak-driven notes of vanilla and leather softly shade the background and fuel a soft, supple mouthfeel. The wine is generous, polished, well integrated and will drink beautifully for decades to come., 94.0, 255.0
US, Hawk Hill Vineyard, You'll find plenty of fruit, in the way of ripe mangoes, peaches, green apples and limes, as well as a sweet coating of smoky oak. However, it's elevated by brisk acidity and a stony, tangy minerality that must come from the soil of this cool-climate vineyard., 93.0, 44.0
France, , This is a wine for aging. The tannins are dense, very dry with a feel of extraction. It takes a while for the black currant fruit to show through, with acidity and freshness dominant. The wine is still settling, and time will bring the fruit into line with the tannins., 94.0, 455.0
Germany, Erdener Treppchen Trockenbeerenauslese, Rich and thickly textured, this wine features intense botrytis aromas of dried apricots, backing them up with flavors of honey and orange marmalade. Long and intensely sugary on the finish, with enough sugar to genuinely stand up to desserts. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC., 93.0, 144.0
US, Odyssey, Smells and tastes not quite ripe. Now that the wine is softening and resolving at the age of 3-1/2 years, it's showing a streak of veggie green behind the cherries., 83.0, 34.0
Germany, Alte Reben, Sweet-tart red cherry and pastry notes are enticing, but the big char and smoke make it hard to focus on the palate's abundance of juicy red-fruit flavors. Fine-grained yet persistent tannins extend the finish. It ends with a delicate spray of violet perfume., 86.0, 77.0
France, , With 83% Sémillon in the blend, this wine has weight as well as richness. At the same time, it has a crisp edge, a smoky character from wood aging and the fine balance between citrus and more exotic fruits. It is a wine to age for many years. Drink from 2022., 97.0, 698.0
France, Les Preuses Grand Cru, There is much concentration and freshness here, along with much power and intense minerality. The wine is very rich with butter, ripe fruit and layers of considerable acidity. Wait 6 years at least., 95.0, 76.0
US, Sagemoor, This is 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 10% Syrah. Deeply fruity, dark and juicy, with huge berry flavors, but there is more to it—the flavors dig deeper, going into earth and spice and olive and toast. The fruit is the star here, and it's amazingly young and still primary. Where will this go? It'll be fun to find out., 92.0, 33.0
US, Isoceles Reserve, An enormously ripe wine, as sweet as a dessert pastry, with licorice, currant, chocolate, brown sugar and oak flavors. The tannins are soft, and the alcohol is very high., 87.0, 98.0
US, To Kalon Vineyard I Block, Explosive. Like the Reserve Fumé on steroids. Tons of tropical fruit, persimmon, passion fruit, lime and fig, with rich, bright acidity, all seamlessly married to oak. Showy, flashy and flamboyant., 94.0, 65.0
Spain, La Nieta, This single-vineyard Rioja always impresses through its impeccable balance, depth of aromas and richness. Aromas of jammy blackberry come with blueberry, orange peel, graham cracker and graphite. It's tight and mildly tannic, with pure boysenberry, cassis, roasted plum, charred spice and toast flavors. Coconut, vanilla and coffee flavors are on the front side of the finish. A beautiful wine that will be best from 2013–2016., 94.0, 165.0
US, Le Reflexion, Clean and dry, but unbalanced, with raisin skin tannins that make the wine feel harsh and astringent. The addition of Viognier to the Syrah adds citrusy acids to the black currants. Needs greater richness., 84.0, 55.0
Spain, Gran Resalte, Despite the high price and small quantity (125 cases total), this wine is not performing at an optimal level. The nose, based on 32 months in oak, is drying and minty, with more dill and leather than fruit. The palate, meanwhile, is sharp and elevated by acidity, while the flavors are of tart fruit, tobacco and vanilla. Best with food; drink now because it's not going to improve., 86.0, 87.0
France, La Richemonne Cuvée Ultra Premier Cru, Made from grapes sourced from vines planted in 1902, this is a huge, powerful, minerally wine. It's currently tight as a drum, with solid tannins and great density that pair with ripe plum and wood flavors. The acidity that appears on the finish promises long-term aging., 94.0, 365.0
France, Bougros Bouguerots Grand Cru, Using the old name for Bougros, this is from the steepest portion of the Bougros vineyard. The pure chalk soil gives it pronounced minerality, and it shows firm structure, with green apples, toast and a very firm, tight character. This wine definitely needs to age; give it 5–8 years., 95.0, 86.0
US, Brosseau Vineyard, A beautiful Pinot Noir. So dry and elegant, so light and crisp in the mouth, and yet so complex. Continues a string of impressive wines from this remote vineyard. Shows mineral-inflected cherry, currant and cola flavors, in a full-bodied wine with great density and finish. Now–2016, at least., 93.0, 54.0
US, , The grapes are from the estate in Yountville, just south of Oakville, and young Dominus always seems tight and austere. So it is here. Astringent tannins, youthful acids and new oak are upfront, raising the question of ageability. It's a roll of the dice. The wine is balanced and harmonious, but aggressive now., 87.0, 109.0
Italy, Bricco Asili Bricco Asili, From the celebrated Bricco Asili cru, this Barbaresco is a beautiful embodiment of elegance, grace, harmony and complexity. Fine aromas of small berry fruit, violets, cola, dark spice and fresh licorice root peel off layer after layer. The wine shows excellent structure, with tight, firm tannins and a bright touch of acidity on the long finish., 93.0, 154.0
US, Estate Grown Produced and Bottled, This is a really terrific white wine, from a variety that's fast gaining traction, although few are producing it. More should. It's classically dry and crisp, with mineral-infused flavors of apricots, green apples and spices. So good and complex, and exceptionally versatile at the table., 91.0, 22.0
France, Le Clos Blanc de Vougeot Premier Cru Monopole, Initial high toast aromas soften to bring out spice and yellow fruits. The palate shows more fruit, but still gives layered wood over the citrus, apricot and final acidity. There is a golden feel of superripe fruit. Drink over the next 3–4 years. Imported by Boisset America., 91.0, 122.0
US, Lewis Vineyard, Winemaker Eric Dunham was the first to latch onto the fruit coming from this exceptional site in the Rattlesnake Hills, and this is as good as any Syrah made in Washington. An awesome nose with spectacular intensity spills out of the glass, carrying superb raspberry scents. The wine is crisp and focused, intense and nuanced. Flavors float from raspberry into the cherry cola realm, heading for a lingering, elegant finish., 94.0, 75.0
US, Reserve 50 Late Disgorged, The deep-gold color shows how long this wine has been aging. Smoky, toasted baguette aromas lead to very rich flavors that taste almost sweet but are appetizingly dry. The fruit notes go from ripe white cherry at the base to vivid lemon and kiwi for top notes. A lavish, long finish echoes butter and apple butter flavors., 94.0, 175.0
Chile, Reserva, Toying with oak on a basic wine such as this can be a dangerous thing, and thus when something smells and tastes and finishes as roasted and burnt as this does, we don't much like it. Expect earthy, leathery fruit flavors along with huge amounts of char, tar, peanuts and baked leather. It has decent mouthfeel and structure, but the nose and flavor profile are compromised by way too much char., 81.0, 12.0
Italy, Fondo Filara, Fondo Filara is a blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato, two important indigenous grapes. This expression offers tangy spice, bright fruit and a fresh, lean mouthfeel., 87.0, 19.0
France, Cristal Brut, Exceptionally rich and dense, an exceptional wine that reveals itself in layers, from the first fruit attack to the mineral texture and the way it gradually fills the mouth. Selected from old vines, there is a great flavor in this wine, with the promise of many years' aging., 97.0, 229.0
US, Pluribus, Very dark, dramatic, opulent, but young. Opens with brooding aromas of black currants, cassis and spices, and turns dense in tannins in the mouth. Deeply refined, concentrated, intense, bone dry. A classic Napa wine in every sense, and one in need of extended cellaring. 2012–2018. The release date is Spring 2010., 94.0, 275.0
US, Private Reserve, So far, 2005 hasn't been a great year for Beringer's Bordeaux-style wines, and the Private Reserve is a disappointment, although it's still a good wine. A bit tough and gritty now, it shows medicinal cherry and currant flavors, and the tannins have an edge of greenness. With its dry, sharp finish, it might develop complexities over the years., 87.0, 119.0
Italy, Vigna Paganelli Riserva, Riserva Vigna Paganelli is an outstanding wine with bold chocolate and exotic spice aromas that are folded deep within the wine's solid, succulent structure. This expression earns high marks thanks to the impressively rich and creamy feel it imparts in the mouth., 95.0, 96.0
Spain, Sentius, Joan Simó had great success in 2005. This wine is excellent and the higher-end Les Eres is outstanding, so bottom line: buy Simó from 2005. Getting back to Sentius, a so-called “second” wine, it is dark, sexy, smooth and shows true Priorat accents of schist, coffee, cola and berry aromas. The flavors are flashy and fresh, with mammoth black cherry, plum and coffee virtually jumping from the glass. A very deep and balanced wine to drink now through 2013., 92.0, 43.0
Italy, Guardiavigna, Here's an earthy expression of Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot that opens with aromas of tilled soil, leather, tobacco, game and bluish-black fruit. The ripe, chewy palate doles out juicy plum, blackberries, cloves and licorice alongside velvety tannins., 92.0, 143.0
Argentina, , Rubbery and warm on the nose, with good berry aromas that turn flatter under the microscope. The palate shows sweet, baked berry flavors and brown sugar, while the feel is round, gritty and full of life. Nice for $8., 86.0, 8.0
US, Sleepy Hollow Vineyard, Disappointing for this legendary vineyard; a soft, medicinal Pinot with funky, mushroomy cherry flavors., 82.0, 33.0
Italy, Vigneto Much, Barbera Vigneto Much showcases sweet aromas of vanilla, cinnamon and cedar wood behind loads of black fruit and wild berries. The wine is lean and compact on the close with a very cleansing, fresh finish., 87.0, 29.0
Italy, Camarcanda, From Angelo Gaja's beautiful estate in coastal Tuscany, this super Tuscan expression delivers opulent aromas of powdered chocolate, black fruit, exotic spice, clove, leather and tobacco. The wine is beautifully integrated and harmonious and ends with impressive staying power and persistency., 93.0, 164.0
US, Jensen Vineyard, Pioneering winemaker Josh Jensen delivers pure and focused aromas of deep red pomegranate and dark purple fruits, a shred of violet, a noticeable chalkiness and a hint of sweet sage. It's rich and zesty on the palate, offering dark fruit flavors with a pine sap backbone, finishing strong on chocolate-dipped cherries., 94.0, 85.0
US, Sonoma Mountain-Top Vineyards, Awkward. Despite some cherry jam and candied licorice flavors, accented by quite a bit of oak, there's a semi-sweet sharpness in the finish reminiscent of cough medicine, and a touch of sweaty funk., 83.0, 54.0
France, , A firm and tannic wine, this has dry spices, dark fruits and concentration. Great depth of flavor gives a serious wine that also has a fruit-driven profile. Concentrated dark tannins push this wine to a great height and impressive length. Drink from 2020., 97.0, 639.0
US, Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard, A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from a prominent site, this wine boasts bright, juicy red cassis and pomegranate fruit supported by complex layers of dried herb, coconut and pencil shavings. Ready to enjoy now and through 2021, it finishes with a taste of bittersweet chocolate., 94.0, 185.0
US, Cuvée l'Etrier, Tough in acids and tannins, with a gritty mouthfeel. Although the blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors are very rich and pure, the wine's aggressiveness interferes with its enjoyment. Doesn't seem likely to improve with age., 84.0, 75.0
France, , A big, powerful wine that brings together dark tannins and dense fruit. The fruit flavors are ripe black plum buried within the concentrated dryness of the tannin. No question, this needs aging for all its burly potential to be realized., 94.0, 285.0
Germany, Graacher Himmelreich Auslese GoldKap, So lusciously ripe, with notes of mango and guava, this is an explosion of sweet fruit, honey and flowers. Searing citrus acidity cuts through the palate, highlighting layers of crushed stone and tea leaf that add complexity. It's so exquisitely delicate, but lingers endlessly on the finish., 95.0, 107.0
US, Bien Nacido Vineyard, What a roll Fess Parker Winery is on with their '08 Chardonnays. Not only great wine, but priced so well. This wine, sourced from Parker's U Block in this famous Santa Maria Valley vineyard, is as rich as any Chardonnay of the vintage—just massive in pineapple, pear and buttered toast flavors. Yet it's crisp and tart, clean and bracing in its minerality. Only 115 cases produced., 96.0, 28.0
Italy, Arcanum II, From Kendall-Jackson, this Merlot is warm and toasty, with aromas of popcorn, roasted plum and leather. The palate is a bit more settled, and it's where you'll find dark cherry flavors resting on a bed of rubbery, lively tannins. Finishes with toast, vanilla and char, along with another dose of spiky tannins., 85.0, 96.0
US, La Rochelle Vineyard, Good example of cool Central Coast Pinot, with its polished, jammy flavors of cherry and raspberry and dusty spices, complexed with smoky oak. Bright acidity and gentle tannins make for an easy drink. Light, but a pretty good value., 86.0, 18.0
Germany, Herrenberg Eiswein, Von Schubert bottled two eisweins from the Herrenberg in 2009. This one is pale in color, with intense pineapple and honey flavors. The wine is sweet, luscious and viscous yet never cloying, with a long finish that features unfolding layers of fruit flavor., 96.0, 228.0
France, , Toasty aromas are not enough to smother the intense, rich and concentrated fruitiness of this powerful wine. Structured and with a firm backbone, it is slow in developing. its brooding dark character still very obvious. However, the fruit is all there, waiting to release the burst of red-berry flavors. Drink from 2022., 95.0, 307.0
US, Brosseau Vineyard, Earthy, like some Napa Chards, with a sage and thyme edge to the pear and peach fruit. The wine also is a little soft. But there's an interesting minerality. Could develop bottle complexity over the next few years., 87.0, 39.0
France, Cristal Brut, The iconic Roederer Champagne, Cristal's latest release, brings a perfect balance of richness and age worthiness. It is full of apple flavor, and the mousse is very fine and almost imperceptible. As so often with a beautifully blended wine like this, a few minutes breathing brings out extra complex flavors. It certainly should age over five years and more., 97.0, 249.0
Italy, Le Vigne, Sandrone has crafted a pleasant if slightly less ambitious wine than usual. It is a rich wine, with plenty of fruit, but overall is a little straightforward and lacks complexity., 86.0, 118.0
US, Bucher Vineyard, This is beautifully lilting in preciously defined aromas of rose petal and wild strawberry. From there, it's all subtlety and ethereal elegance. The wine is restrained, nurtured in a basket of nutmeg and graham cracker, as well as freshly packed mushroomy earth. This wine is a stunner right out of the glass, but is sure to continue its fine course through 2022–2025., 97.0, 59.0
US, Clos Pepe Vineyard, Huge, rich, white Burgundy style Chardonnay. Has a pie-filling fruity richness of pineapples, lemondrop, pears, kiwi fruit and exotic kumquats, balanced with fine, minerally acidity, and wrapped into a buttercream texture. The oak is flamboyant, but perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. Dazzling and dramatic, from a vineyard that just keeps performing better and better., 96.0, 38.0
US, , A deceptive Pinot. It shows a pale color and a very delicate, silky mouthfeel, but the impact on the palate can only be described as explosive, and the aftertaste is very rich. The flavors of cherries, cotton candy, red raspberries, orange tea, smoky vanilla, cinnamon, cloves and brown sugar are compelling. Best now and through 2010., 94.0, 95.0
Italy, Armonia, Armonia (a Sangiovese-based wine from central Tuscany) offers hot and jammy aromas of cherry maraschino, dried prune and black leather. The wine imparts a thick, chewy feel in the mouth., 87.0, 49.0
US, , Lots of ripe red cherry, pomegranate, cola and sandalwood flavors in this dry Pinot Noir. It lacks vibrant acidity to give life to the richness. Drink now., 86.0, 28.0
France, Domaine des Perdrix, This is a big, smoky wine that's packed with ripe fruits, firm tannins and layers of wood. Firm, solid and concentrated, the wine's black fruits show through the dense texture. It has great potential—age for at least five years., 94.0, 195.0
France, , New wood influence and extraction give the wine a bitter edge, and a dark chocolate flavor dominates. It has a core of ripe black fruit that will round out as it develops. Solid, chunky, firm and dense., 87.0, 149.0
Australia, , An interesting mix is at work here: You get the Chardonnay body and pear flavors and some nuttiness from the 60% Sémillon. Quite a straight-ahead wine, with more neutrality than nuance; the flavor profile ultimately veers toward citrus and almond. Overall it's forward and clean-tasting, with enough creaminess to satisfy., 85.0, 7.0
US, Holy Smoke, The least successful of this bottling in some years. The wine is just too ripe and raisiny-sweet, with a white sugar edge to the cherries, cassis and blackberries that's almost like a dessert wine., 84.0, 85.0
France, , This is a concentrated, dark and brooding wine. Its complexity comes from the interplay of tannins and rich red fruits, laced with tight acidity. Serious and dense, it is a wine for long aging. Drink this impressive wine from 2019., 92.0, 153.0
US, Sangiacomo Vineyard, Ripe, lush and immediately attractive, this Chard offers rich tiers of pineapple custard, pear marmalade, vanilla, buttered toast, toasted coconut and Asian spice flavors. It's a strong, flamboyant wine that calls for equally strong foods, like lobster., 91.0, 32.0
Spain, , Campo de Borja can produce some strange wines, and at the head of the class would be this rooty, tomato-laden wine that's at one point sweet but then bland and cooked at the next. A varietal Garnacha from a hot vintage that just isn't worth the price., 82.0, 43.0
US, L'Ermitage Brut, This impressive bubbly has apple, caramel and toffee aromas, melt-in-the-mouth Bosc pear and spice rack flavors, a rich but firm texture, and long finish. It possesses amazing liveliness, body and depth, and seems to reveal more nuances and freshness with each sip. While terrific to drink now, it can be cellared through at least 2020., 96.0, 48.0
France, Grand Cru Clos Saint-Urbain Rangen de ThannSéléction des Grains Nobles, The ultimate in SGN wines, because it not only has richness, sweetness, and botrytis, but it also offers acidity, balance and total seduction. There are flavors of peaches and mirabelles, but they are really all submerged in the amazing elegance of a wine that will age indefinitely., 97.0, 269.0
US, , Very forward in jammy fruit, with waves of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, red currants, mocha and caramelized new oak. Feels too soft and melted to do much in the cellar, so drink up., 87.0, 59.0
US, , Dark and racy, with a Northern Rhône-style aroma of black pepper, cedar and black currants, but there's nothing Rhône-like about the flavor. It's distinctly California, with soft, sweetly ripe tannins bursting with blackberry jam, black currants, anise, vanilla and sweet oak flavors. The wine is fully dry. Absolutely first-rate Syrah., 95.0, 27.0
Italy, I Quadretti, Aged in small oak barrels for 24 months, I Quadretti offers burnt aromas of cedar and incense followed by rose potpourri and scented candle. The close is sour and slightly bitter., 86.0, 38.0
US, Vintners' Reserve Red, An eclectic blend of 55% Ruby Cabernet and 45% Tempranillo turns out an off-beat wine, with smoke and char notes dominating the nose and a tinge of perfumed hand soap hanging behind the raspberry fruit in the mouth. It's pointedly crisp, with slightly overworked tannins but an agreeable final note of mixed berries., 81.0, 22.0
Australia, , Comes off as a slightly skinny Pinot Noir, with herbal overtones to the cherry and strawberry flavors. Still, it's varietally true, and light enough in body to pair effectively with chicken or salmon. Drink now., 85.0, 17.0
France, Perrières Premier Cru, Rich, full, powerful Chardonnay, with yellow fruits balanced with lemon, green apple and white currants. The structure, though, pushes the wine into a mineral direction, adding tightness and toast to the ebullient fruit. Age for 4–5 years and more., 94.0, 106.0
Italy, Tenuta Nuova, Gorgeous, opulent and rich, Tenuta Nuova is an unforgettable wine. It has body, power, persistence and loads of plush personality. It is layered with chocolate, cherry, blackberry, spice, leather and savory notes. There's a deep mineral layer as well. Compelling and lovely., 97.0, 79.0
France, , Bouchard owns some fine parcels in Clos de Vougeot and this shows in the dense character of the wine, with its minerality and tight structure. It is dark, brooding almost, very dry, but likely to age well over many years., 94.0, 206.0
US, Yountville Selection, Despite its age, this wine still is pretty tannic, but the worse problem is a vegetal character. There's a suggestion of canned asparagus despite scads of oak. Not going anywhere., 84.0, 95.0
US, Westside Road Neighbors, A blend of the winery's various vineyard sources in the Russian River Valley, this is soft and rich, with berry, cherry and oak flavors. Performance wise, it's a little off from the past several years—no doubt due to the challenges of the difficult 2010 vintage—so drink up., 87.0, 69.0
US, Père de Famille, This is taut, muscular, toasty, young and tight; the fruit is concentrated, pure and evocative, with earthy flavors that add notes of soil, spice and mineral. The most complex of all the Betz blends, in this vintage it includes 84% Cabernet Sauvignon—far and away the dominant flavor. The fruits unfold in a rich panoply of reds and blues; the tannins are rich and chewy, polished and complex, showing exemplary back of the palate grip and concentration., 96.0, 58.0
US, Laki's Vineyard Estate, While soft and approachable, this wine also offers a density of black currant and cherry that gives significant power and juicy exuberance. Sizable tannins risk overtaking the fruit, but never do, with the oak imparting a jolt of smokiness on the finish., 90.0, 111.0
US, Ma Vie Carol, This ambitious winery continues to struggle to find the formula for pricy Chardonnay. They turn now to this new Sonoma County appellation, but the result is still pretty ordinary. The wine is all about buttered toast, popcorn and fruit jam, with a creamy texture that's universally appealing., 86.0, 48.0
US, Fort Ross Vineyard, What a beautiful Pinot Noir for drinking now with lamb chops or maybe a rich, exotic Ahi tuna tartare. Brilliantly crisp in acidity, with a clean, bracing mouthfeel, it offers dazzlingly rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, orange zest, Dr. Pepper cola and Asian spices, with smoky oak adding elaborate tiers of vanilla char. For the price, it's a very great buy., 95.0, 37.0
Germany, Berg Roxheim Erste Lage Trockenbeerenauslese, Scents of sweet spice and orange marmalade waft exuberantly from this honey-kissed TBA. Lusciously sweet, the palate undulates with waves of mango, melon and pineapple flavor, accented with notes of potpourri and saffron. Lingers long with a shower of delicate acidity., 95.0, 237.0
US, Reserve Signature, Though lacking the weight and complexity generally associated with reserve wines, this delicate little Pinot offers pale red fruits, tart acids and moderate tannins. Much like a simple Bourgogne from a modest vintage., 85.0, 27.0
US, Joy!, This multivintage bottling is extraordinarily rich in orange fruit. You'll find complex layers of smoky butter, yeasty brioche, vanilla and toasted oak. What's so remarkable, though, is the mouthfeel: While it's brisk in acidity, it feels as soft and gentle as satin. It's so beautiful now that you'll find it difficult to keep from drinking the entire magnum immediately., 97.0, 189.0
US, Balistreri Family Vineyard Freestone View Block, Quite tart as you'd expect from a coastal vineyard in this region, with acid-inspired long hangtime flavors of cherries and raspberries, accented with smoky oak. Tastes a tad sweet and fruit-bomby at the age of three years., 87.0, 79.0
US, Secco, This dry Moscato Giallo from Lodi is delicious, with an intensely perfumed nose that follows through in the taste, alongside Meyer lemon, jasmine and cantaloupe. Very unusual, incredibly well priced and modest in alcohol, this lush, ginger-tinged Moscato is this taster's desert-island white., 94.0, 16.0
France, , This mature, toasty wine is made by the Secondé family, grandchildren of Edmond Barnaut. It is developing attractive, roasted almond and very ripe flavors. Drink now., 86.0, 58.0
US, , A blast of clean, ripe citrus, peach and pear fruit greets you from this well-made, if simple, wine. There are vanilla and smoke elements from wood. It's a little soft, and a tad off-dry, but if you need a case of something white to quench the throats of party-goers who aren't real particular, this is the ticket., 84.0, 6.0
France, Le Pavillon Ermitage, Le Pavillon is drawn from Les Bessards, the most granitic of Hermitage's climats, resulting in a wine with pronounced structure and minerailty. Hints of cinnamon and clove join plum and crushed stone on the nose, while the concentrated flavors suggest iron or beef blood as well. Drink 2015–2030., 94.0, 316.0
US, Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard, This is a small production barrel selection from the estate vineyard in Green Valley. It's very rich and quite young, too primary and tannic to drink now, but extraordinarily rich in the cherries, blackberries, blueberries and Asian spices that characterize the estate. Best 2008–2012., 95.0, 47.0
Italy, Costa Grimaldi, This wine needed time in the glass to really show its stuff. At first, a touch volatile and funky, this soon blew off, and the wine showed plenty of sweet fruit, rose petal and licorice. Fairly evolved, this is a wine that should be enjoyed over the next five years., 87.0, 89.0
France, Gloeckelberg Grand Cru Grande Reserve, While the aromas on this example are not perfectly clean, they are followed by a burst of flavor that makes up for it all. Indian spices and macadamia nuts are punctuated by apricot fruit and wrapped up in a glossy texture. Long, nutty finish. Drink now to one year., 85.0, 37.0
US, Allen Vineyard, A joy to drink now, and will develop over a decade or more. A dry, pure, focused wine whose intricately detailed cherry, cola and cranberry flavors are enhanced by minerally things from the earth and a near-perfect application of oak. Changes by the second in the glass, ever fascinating., 96.0, 78.0
US, Elevage Blanc, A lovely white Bordeaux-style blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sauvignon Gris, rich, opulent and full-bodied. Shows citrus, tropical fruit, pear, white flower, green apple and oak-inspired vanilla flavors that change with every sip, as the wine warms in the glass., 91.0, 42.0
US, Estate, Pickles and dill in the nose, with underlying cherries and blackberries. In the mouth, it enters brawny and rustic, and very tannic. The fruit is locked down. Seems sound, but disappointingly tough. Could develop, but it's a gamble. Tasted twice., 86.0, 68.0
France, Mambourg Grand Cru, Apple, lemon oil and vinosity unite to such a degree that the nose is completely heady: here is a Riesling at the very cusp of maturity, a trajectory that has only just begun. The dry palate also reveals hints of lanolin and peach but is utterly governed by lemon freshness. This is sleek and taut, and gives you a glimpse of what mature dry Riesling can be: incisive, complex but eternally fresh. The finish is utterly clean. Drink now through 2030., 94.0, 26.0
Italy, Saffredi, Vintner Elisabetta Geppetti's Saffredi is part cult wine and part mainstream blockbuster in that the wine enjoys worldwide fame, but few know it well. This vintage is soft and luscious, with loads of dark chocolate, cherry, blackberry, tobacco and spice. It's gorgeous down to the last delicious drop., 94.0, 126.0
New Zealand, Esslin, Shows obvious oak influence that seems almost like maple syrup in character; also solid black-cherry fruit that has just a hint of dried herbs. Low acidity gives it an appealing lushness., 87.0, 99.0
Spain, PV Petit Verdot, This is an interesting wine that offers a nice perfume but limited flavors and complexity. So what makes it so interesting, you ask? Well, the fact that it's varietal Petit Verdot from the Duero River Valley, which is not common; that and the fact that it's a mind-boggling $200. The wine itself shows a deep color, vanilla and cocoa flavors, and a range of dark-berry flavors. Elegant and provacative, it's not., 87.0, 199.0
US, , A bit rugged and hot in the mouth. Offers a good array of plummy cherry flavor, with bright, zingy acidity and a touch of smoky oak., 84.0, 16.0
US, Meredith Estate, This is an amazingly complex wine and a fine expression of the cool vintage. Perhaps the most notable feature is acidity; it's strong, almost tingly, and will certainly help the wine age. The flavors are explosive yet refined, with notes of cherries, cola, pomegranates and plums. Good as it is to drink now, you'll want to cellar it until 2018, and it will provide beauty for many additional years., 95.0, 57.0
Italy, Zovo, This Amarone shows the heat of the vintage. It has black fruit and spice notes but the palate is dominated by searing alcohol sensations. It lacks richness and fresh acidity, and closes on a bitter note., 85.0, 47.0
France, Petit Monts Premier Cru, Big and bold with great strawberry and red cherry flavors, this wine has all the elements of dense fruit, intense acidity and rich tannins. The structure is dark and full of potential. With acidity at the end to give a lift of freshness, this is a wine for the long-term. Drink from 2020., 95.0, 357.0
US, , Stewed and vegetal, with hard, bitter tannins. This does not taste as if the grapes ripened sufficiently, and the extraction is such that green, bitter tannins are the main flavor., 81.0, 32.0
US, , This is a gigantic expression of the variety, from high-elevation sites, an explosion of coffee, black licorice and red fruit. With a powerful backbone of bittersweet tannins and weight, the finish is reminiscent of cigar smoke., 86.0, 78.0
Spain, Cirsion, Char and chocolate, then a dollop of rum raisin and black cherry, and there is your nose. This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular. But that doesn't mean you won't love the wine's smooth texture, cocoa and baked berry flavors, and its overall generous character. Drink now through 2010., 92.0, 273.0
Italy, Podere Grattamacco, Focused and tight in style, this wine has linear and elegant aromas of bright cherry, spice, dark chocolate and licorice. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese, and it shows firm, dry and dusty tannins on the finish., 93.0, 105.0
US, , One of the best Merlots of the vintage, at a good price for the quality. Shows a structural quality and ripeness that are pure Oakville, with ultra-refined tannins, good acidity and plush, complex flavors of black cherries, red currants and licorice that go on and on into a long, spicy finish. New oak comprises 40% of the barrels, and adds beautiful notes of toast and warmth., 94.0, 36.0
France, Vintage Brut, A great celebration of the fine 2004 vintage, this wine reveals both generosity and a steely resolve. It has a cool elegance as well, giving it a sense of refinement, while still preserving the Roederer richness. The tight acidity holds the wine together and promises long aging., 95.0, 67.0
Spain, Amancio, Brawny but lovely, with monster black fruit, balsam wood, tobacco and cola nut aromas. The palate is ultra rich and modern in style, with deep, brandied flavors of cola, black cherry and spice. Driven, modern and properly tannic, with a fair amount of mocha and creaminess on the finish. Drink from late 2010 thru 2014., 95.0, 167.0
France, , Chave's white Hermitage is even better than his acclaimed red in 2004. It's wonderfully toasty upfront, backed by layer upon layer of honeyed fruit that simply defies description. Yet despite the incredible richness, there's also tremendous focus and minerality, so that the wine never seems overly weighty, and it finishes with great length and intensity. Drink it now, or try it in 15 years; the 1991 is singing now at age 16., 96.0, 98.0
US, , Siduri's basic Russian River bottling is very ripe in fruit, heavy in texture and soft, with a cherry, coffee and chocolate syrup flavor. It's as tasty as a candy. Drink now., 84.0, 26.0
France, Cuvée Signature, Fresh citrus and peach juice flavors are light, certainly not concentrated, but the wine has some pear skin spice and toast. It has crispness, poise and balance, with a delicious finale of bright acidity. Imported by Boisset America., 85.0, 57.0
France, Clos Tavannes, Dark chocolate notes join acidity and ripe black fruit flavors. The wood is dominant in this relatively soft wine, although the fruit juiciness comes through well to finish., 86.0, 88.0
Portugal, Vintage, Perfectly mature, this Port's tannins have softened over the past 40-plus years, leaving it lushly textured and displaying rich fig and chocolate flavors. Finishes long, picking up a touch of almond to go with the fig, flavors Symington calls “Dow's hallmarks.” Drink now–2015, longer if you prefer very mature wines., 95.0, 467.0
US, Kessler-Haak Vineyard, Just wonderful, showing the great richness and complexity of a top Santa Rita Pinot Noir. Partial whole-cluster fermentation gives the wine a spicy earthiness and full-bodied tannins, yet the underlying red berry and cherry fruit shines through. Showing well now and over the next six years., 94.0, 46.0
Germany, Abstberg Beerenauslese, A stunningly rich yet balanced dessert wine, this beauty starts with hints of paraffin and almonds, then unleashes waves of sweet dried-apricot and orange-marmalade flavors. Despite the intense, honeyed sweetness, there's enough lime-like acidity to prevent it from being cloying. This tour de force should age effortlessly for 40 or more years., 95.0, 177.0
US, Muscat a Petits Grains Vin Doux Naturel, Bill Easton doesn't make this dessert wine every year, so when he does, especially of this caliber, it's a good time to pick up some of this deliciously balanced dessert delight. It's a very nuanced rendering of crisp, clean peach, pear and honey flavors that would go well with fruit desserts or anything involving almond paste., 93.0, 15.0
US, Estate Grown Mother Rock, A brooding, savory and smoothly textured wine, velvety more than silky, this offers black tea, truffle and high-toned cherry. The wine is named for sandstone, “mother rock” of the Goldridge soils that are so prominent where these vines dig down. Soft, it's also lengthy, a substantial and substantive bottling., 93.0, 115.0
Italy, Suolo, Argiano's Suolo is a true standout in the world of Tuscan Sangiovese. It achieves elegance, complexity and richness with bright cherry notes contrasted against sweet vanilla and spicy oak. The finish is long, smooth and persistent., 92.0, 83.0
US, Estate, There's a burnt taste to this wine that could be a result of sun-burnt fruit or overly-charred, obviously toasted oak, or both. At any rate, although the black currant and mocha flavors are pleasant, the wine feels harsh in the mouth., 84.0, 36.0
France, La Chapelle, A big step up from Jaboulet's La Petite Chapelle, this is on a par with some of Jaboulet's past efforts. It's richly concentrated, yet nuanced, with notes of blood and mineral added to ripe cassis fruit and accented by hints of vanilla and spice. The tannins form an almost creamy texture in the mouth, and the finish lingers a good long time. Drink 2012–2025., 93.0, 215.0
US, Doctor's Vineyard, Tasted at a little more than a year of age, this Pinot Noir is a bit brusque. It should have been held back for another six months, to let the tannins, fruit and oak knit together. With very rich black cherry, black raspberry, cola and sweet smoky oak flavors, it should begin to resolve by late Fall 2010, and provide pleasant drinking for another 3–4 years., 91.0, 52.0
France, Grand Cru Hengst Wintzenheim, This is one of the most powerful in the range of Zind-Humbrecht's extraordinary Gewürztraminers. It is packed with spice and pepper, and is rich, but dry. Its power comes from the sheer concentration of fruit. This is the sort of wine that needs to be drunk by itself—it will dominate any food., 95.0, 87.0
Argentina, Saurus Patagonia, Familia Schroeder is making good, restrained wines in Neuquén. This Merlot won't rock your world but it will deliver firm, fresh raspberry flavors, food-friendly acidity and solid tannins. And it's even got some chewy sweetness., 86.0, 9.0
France, Héritiers Paul Chanson, From vines owned by the Chanson family, this is a wonderfully rich wine, deliciously fruity at the same time. Apple and citrus as well as richer apricots come through powerfully. It's structured with a sense of opulence, richness that also has a tight texture. It needs to age; drink from 2019., 95.0, 187.0
US, Weir Vineyard, A spectacular, beautiful wine, the best Williams Selyem Weir ever. This wine can be rustic, and the '09 shows the vineyard's edgy tannin structure and earthiness. But it's so rich in fruit, mocha and spices, so elegant, with such a delicacy despite the power, you have to admire it. Not ready, though. Give it at least six years., 94.0, 56.0
France, Le Château Kastelberg Grand Cru, Quite funky indeed. Saturated with spice such as anise, clove and rotting apples on the orchard floor, the earthy, full-bodied and slightly viscous nature of this beast is overwhelming. We're not quite sure if this one warrants the hefty price tag attached to it., 85.0, 77.0
France, Les Perrières Premier Cru, Like many wines from Lafon, this is initially deceptive. It bursts open in the mouth, like a fruit bomb. But watch for the structure as well, because this is a wine that will age. Keep for at least 5 years., 94.0, 156.0
Austria, Franziskus, Green pears and ivy leaves, together with zesty lemon, bring a very slender and precise focus to this wine that promises refreshment and ageing mileage. Drink now or keep until 2015–2016., 90.0, 21.0
US, Old Vine, The primary source of this Zin is from Dry Creek Valley. It's rare to find this quality and quantity of upfront fruit in a Zin that's so balanced, but here it is. Massive raspberry, cherry, blackberry, mocha and Asian spice flavors, with buttery, smoky oak notes. Just delicious. Drink now., 93.0, 25.0
US, Reserve, This is a big, hard, tannic wine. It's so buttoned up, the question is whether it will age. Most of the signs say yes. It's gigantically rich in blackberries, cassis and chocolate, with a berried sweetness accented by the caramel of toasted oak. Acidity is just fine. On the other hand, the alcohol is notable, giving it peppery heat. A very fine, flashy, impressive wine, but its future is obscure., 93.0, 125.0
Italy, , Here's an easy Pinot Grigio with sweet flavors of white peach and nectarine and a thin, firm mouthfeel. The wine ends with a piquant touch of spice and crisp acidity., 86.0, 19.0
Australia, Grange, Not great by Grange standards, but still a fabulous wine, the 2001 Grange boasts an intoxicating, heady bouquet of rich chocolate and coconut. It follows that up with deep, plummy fruit that's full-bodied and lush yet quite tannic, promising decades of ageability. Despite the dark chocolate and plum flavors, the wine is still fresh, with a long finish. Drink 2010–2025., 93.0, 225.0
Chile, , Sort of an odd yellow in color, with chunky, hard-to-discern aromas. Pear and vanilla control the palate, followed by some banana on the heavy finish. A touch dull for Casablanca Chard. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd., 83.0, 15.0
France, Morgeot Premier Cru, Very mineral textured wine, speaking of limestone soil. It balances a toasty, smoky character against the ripest green and yellow fruits. The citrus lends its acidity to tighten up a finely structured, ageworthy wine., 92.0, 93.0
France, Mambourg Grand Cru, In keeping with his practice of making vineyard, rather than varietal wines, Marcel Deiss blends this wine from different members of the Pinot family. It has a strongly dry spice element as well as fresher fruit and a touch of pears. Complex, it needs to age several years, so drink from 2017., 94.0, 66.0
US, La Masía Don Miguel Vineyard, Absolutely stunning, a testament to the vintage, the terroir and to the winemaker's impeccable hand. It's delicious beyond description, offering wave after wave of cherry pie, blackberry confit, red currant, persimmon and cola flavors, finished with exciting spices. Already throwing sediment, it's so balanced in acids and tannins that it's gorgeous now, but should develop effortlessly over the next six years at the very least., 96.0, 39.0
Spain, La Viña de Andres Romeo, Huge wine with sweetness and smooth qualities from head to toe. Aromas of mint leaf, pastry and sweet black fruits are magnetic, while the lush, layered palate is complete and packed with berry fruit, toast, fudge and tobacco flavors. Layered and deep on the finish, with cola, herbs and licorice notes. Beautiful wine. Drinkable now and good through 2013., 94.0, 166.0
France, , This is heavy on the wood, but it's so rich in fruit as well. An immensely concentrated wine that's powered by its dark tannins and flavors of ripe blackberry, loganberry juice and spice. The acidity is straight as an arrow, giving the wine good lift., 94.0, 266.0
Italy, Case Basse, It's safe to say that Gianfranco Soldera's style is only appreciated and understood by Brunello purists. The wines are as thorny and complex as the argumentative, cantankerous man who makes them. For one, this wine has big volatility but the magic here is that those pungent direct aromas translate into bright aromatic vibrancy and buoyancy. In fact, its intensity and the careful balance between acidity and structure is unmatched., 92.0, 293.0
US, , A rather ordinary Merlot, dry and rugged, with jammy-fruity flavors of cherries, herbs and oak. Blended with Beckstoffer Cabernet Sauvignon, which gives it needed body and power., 86.0, 29.0
US, Proximus, Heavy, sweet and super-oaky, like a liquid infusion of buttered popcorn, pineapple jam and vanilla meringue. Will appeal to many, but purists will find it heavy-handed and manipulated., 84.0, 56.0
US, Frank Johnson Vineyard, Here's a Syrah that marches to the beat of its own drummer. Eschewing massive fruit, it shows a subtle, complex mélange of dried blackberries and bitter black cherries, olive tapenade, tobacco, dark unsweetened chocolate, leather and the white pepper of a fine Syrah. Drink this dramatic wine now and through 2011., 93.0, 35.0
France, Clos Saint-Jacques Premier Cru, Concentrated and powerful, this wine is rich and full in the mouth, with wonderful ripe fruits over the great tannins. It is solid, dark and dense, full of smoky flavors and a rich strawberry flavor. Drink from 2022., 95.0, 208.0
France, Les Cazetiers Premier Cru, Rich, juicy and packed with both wood flavors and delicious red fruits, this concentrated and dense wine has a wonderful sense of freshness. There is a strong mineral texture, with tannins that come from ripe fruit as well as wood. The whole wine is finished with acidity, spice and a full-bodied, rich aftertaste., 93.0, 135.0
Germany, Wehlener Sonnenuhr Trockenbeerenauslese Goldkap, Bottling a TBA in this format makes great sense--it allows the tiny productions to be spread around and made more affordable. This is rich, sweet and superintense, with flavors of boiled down marmalade and honey that finish long, long, long. In this size bottle, opt for drinking it young versus extended cellaring., 96.0, 49.0
Austria, Achleiten Smaragd, A glorious, ripe, spicy wine that keeps its origins clear with its tight edge of stone and steel, which brings the acidity under the sweet pear and yellow berry fruits. With its rich, round finale, this is a firm but opulent wine. Imported by Vin Divino., 94.0, 76.0
France, Clos Mireille Blanc de Blancs, This zesty Provence white is starting to show its age a bit, with faded flowers upfront and a slightly waxy texture. Nonetheless, there's enough to keep the senses entertained, with a pleasant floral edge to the pear-inflected palate and a final butter note. Drink up., 86.0, 39.0
Argentina, Altitud, Aromas of mealy fruit are offset by scents of air freshener and barrel-derived cinnamon. This feels regular and round, with simple apple and wood-spice flavors. The finish tastes wheaty, with a plump feel., 83.0, 25.0
US, Vintners Special Estate Reserve, Soft, sweet and simple, with sugared blackberry tea and sandalwood flavors. Ready now., 83.0, 125.0
Germany, Kiedrich Gräfenberg Eiswein, Perhaps a step behind Weil's other supersweet 2009s, this eiswein remains a prodigious effort. The candied pineapple and golden raisin notes are so intense, so concentrated that they're almost painful to taste, lingering virtually forever on the finish., 94.0, 376.0
Spain, Castillo Ygay Gran Reserva Especial, Old wines are not easy to appreciate, so we'd almost rather have you judge this wine. In our opinion, it's way too sour and lacking in fruit to justify rave reviews. Thirty years of age doesn't seem to have helped it, and what's left is sherried and pruny, yet with sharp acidity., 83.0, 225.0
Italy, Pergole Vece, This first-rate Amarone by Franco Scamperle earns an A for typicity and intensity. The aromas are enticing and pristine, with nuances of forest berry, red apple, chocolate, espresso, resin, chopped herbs and cherry pie. It boasts a lively ruby color, spice-driven flavors (the wine ages three years in barrique) and excellent persistence in the mouth., 95.0, 118.0
US, , Okay in a pinch, but a pretty rugged wine. It has raisin and prune flavors that have a medicinal, tannic finish., 80.0, 11.0
Spain, Señorío de los Llanos Crianza, Cassis, raisin, vanilla and rooty spice aromas give this Tempranillo blend some class on the bouquet. It's resiny and fairly heavy feeling, with lightly burnt and earthy flavors of herbal red berry and plum. Dry and peppery on the finish., 85.0, 8.0
US, Maple Vineyard Bill's Block, There's a peppery heat to this wine from high alcohol, but if you can get past that you'll find a dry, fruity Zin. Rich in spicy wild berry flavors, and turns slightly Porty and raisiny on the finish., 86.0, 49.0
France, Clos de la Maréchale Premier Cru, Beautiful fresh raspberry flavors appear with tannins showing a density and dryness, but the essential is the perfume and the freshness. While it is not a big wine, it does have a solid core of dense fruit, but the end is light, with just a hint of tannin., 92.0, 104.0
US, Intrinity, This is a very low-production, best-of-barrels selection by the winemaker. It's an extremely tight young wine, austere and almost searing in acidity, with a yeasty taste from sur lies aging. If you're looking for opulent, immediately accessible Chardonnay, this isn't for you. But the wine has tantalizing hints of grilled pineapples and nectarines, and the powerful structure suggests cellaring. Stash this away for a couple of years., 93.0, 45.0
Spain, Aurus, Despite not very good harvest conditions, Aurus is still generous in 2008. Smells lush and dense, with boysenberry, creamy oak, rubber and charred aromas. Layered and tannic feeling, with blackberry, chocolate and dark spice flavors. Toasty and like digging into a fudge cake on the finish, with a deep feel and clarity. Drink now through 2018., 92.0, 204.0
US, , New oak stands out in toast and caramelized wood sweetness on this Cab, overshining to some degree the underlying blackberry, cherry and black currant fruit. It's quite a fashionable, delectable young wine, and will probably be consumed too early by many people who buy it, but it's really a cellar candidate. Made with a few drops of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, it should develop for 12–15 years., 93.0, 145.0
Germany, Erdener Prälat Beerenauslese, At only 6% alcohol, this is extremely honeyed on the nose—almost caramelized in its intensity. This is amply reflected on the palate, where its flavors are ultrasweet, like melted peach preserves and honey. Lingers terrifically on the finish., 94.0, 86.0
Germany, Penguin Eiswein, Smells and tastes like scorched creamed corn laced with honey and marmalade. Sweet but not very harmonious. Imported by Broadbent Selections, Inc., 81.0, 52.0
US, Cask 23 Estate Grown, Thick and dense, with managed tannins and a nest of oak, this marquee wine offers classic insight into the Napa Valley. It's weighty and somewhat smoky, with a lurking sense of minerality and balance. A powerful grip gives way on the lengthy finish to satisfying end notes of coffee and toffee., 93.0, 245.0
US, Ashley's Vineyard, Don't drink this beauty too cold with your lobster, crab or scallops. It has the weight of a noble wine, with minerality and creaminess giving shape and texture to the leesy, yeasty flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie and ripe pear purée. Aged in 40% new French oak, California Chardonnay hardly gets any better than this., 95.0, 28.0
Italy, L'Apparita, L'Apparita is a divine and delicate expression of Merlot with rich layers of black cherry, blackberry, spice, mocha, cedar, exotic spice and polished stone that are seamlessly woven together. The wine hits the palate with the softness and richness of the world's best Merlots and leaves a fading impression of fruit and spice that can be counted in many long, delicious minutes. Hold until 2018., 96.0, 169.0
France, , A wine of promise, but still in its infancy. This grand cru, structured and still waiting to open to its full opulence, is packed with concentrated flavors. It's a powerhouse that needs at least five years to even begin to show its structure, ripe fruit and richness., 95.0, 228.0
Greece, Kelinos, This Xinomavro, with its compelling nose of coffee, cinnamon spice and olive, has a rough character that both distinguishes it (showing its Greek blood) and makes it tough to embrace. Tannic and slightly tart, with an underlay of spice, the wine wants more balance and less barb., 83.0, 35.0
France, , Straddling richness and beautiful liveliness, this is going to be an impressive wine. It does need aging. At this stage, the wood is a big element, but then the bright white fruits—pears, white currants along with tangerines—will move center stage. Keep at least six years, almost certainly more., 95.0, 328.0
Spain, Excelencia, Pickled and leesy on the nose, this kosher Cava runs low on verve and bubbles. Scallion, green herb and green banana flavors finish similarly, with herbal notes leading the way. 100% Macabeo., 85.0, 18.0
US, Lewis Vineyards, Reserve, Made in an obviously oaky style, this has spicy, smoky vanilla and nutmeg aromas, plus equally high-intensity and almost sweet flavors. A relatively smooth texture accompanies the full body. Generous and ripe fruit flavors come out with each sip and add depth., 86.0, 59.0
US, Talley Rincon, Massively rich, with pronounced, sweet, smoky oak flavors and a rich vein of tart, creamy lees highlighting the underlying fruity ripeness. Shows flavors of grilled pineapples, tropical mangoes and pears, balanced with crisp acids. Tremendously delicious and compelling., 95.0, 38.0
Italy, Altero, Here's a modern, plush and extracted expression of Sangiovese Grosso that has been enhanced by elegant oak aging. Still young, it exhibits notes of vanilla, toasted coconut, smoke and resin along with a solid base of cassis and dried berry fruit. The texture here is polished and smooth with zesty spice on the close., 94.0, 96.0
Argentina, Viña Federico Villafañe Single Vineyard, Dense, inky and sweet on the nose, with cassis, melted Swiss chocolate and well-integrated spice aromas. The palate has size and acidity, with toasty, creamy flavors of baked black fruits and coconut. Long on the finish, with vanilla and mocha; ripe, delicious and potent. Drink now through 2016., 93.0, 55.0
US, Reserve, This soft, sweet, oaky Cabernet will appeal to those who like the New World style. It's as puffy as a dessert concoction, with cherry, chocolate, nougat and cinnamon spice flavors, and is ready to drink now., 86.0, 69.0
France, Sous le Dos d'Ane Premier Cru, Really ripe wine, with toast and yellow fruits, laced with intense citric acidity and a mineral edge, to go with the mouthwatering fruit. Needs to age for 5–6 years., 93.0, 155.0
US, Proprietor's Reserve, The reserve Merlot lacks the smooth, buttery softness of the regular bottling, substituting stiffer tannins, deeper color and a definite herbal component. Perhaps the thinking is that this will age longer, but for sheer pleasure it does not measure up to its less expensive sibling., 85.0, 28.0
France, , There is an explosion of ripe yellow fruit here, giving a ripe, tropical feel. Spice, mango, it's quite a powerhouse of flavors. This is a gorgeous, opulent wine., 93.0, 255.0
Austria, Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd, This is always a major wine, and this vintage is no exception. It is spectacularly ripe, spicy, concentrated and fruity. The yellow fruits, tangy citrus and mineral structure all contribute to an intense complexity. Age this wine for many years and don't drink before 2017., 96.0, 89.0
France, Les Arènes, A hint of cedar accents aromas of black olive and plum, while the flavors manage to blend those elements into a harmonious, savory package before ending on a lengthy espresso note. This finely textured Cornas may be tough to come by, as only 60 six packs were imported. Drink now–2020., 91.0, 72.0
US, Brut L'Ermitage Estate Bottled, Very fruity and fresh in aroma, this elegant wine has light, crisp apple and lemon flavors, fresh-baked bread accents and lively acidity. A layered texture seems to blend in accents of almond and vanilla, increasing complexity with each sip. It's one of California's blue-chip bubblies., 95.0, 48.0
Germany, Serrig Schloss Saarsteiner Eiswein, One of the palest icewines to come across our tasting table, this is an extraordinarily fine example, with great purity of fruit and incredible balance. Tangerine and pineapple flavors shine with pristine clarity from start to finish, making it very drinkable., 95.0, 448.0
Israel, Dishon Single Vineyard, There's a woody, slightly green center to this wine that dominates the lean cherry and currant notes on the nose and mouth. It's direct and linear on the palate, with a red-plum-skin-driven finish., 85.0, 38.0
Italy, La Serra, This beautiful expression of Nebbiolo from the La Serra cru represents the best of Barolo winemaking tradition. Eugenio Bocchino heads a family-run estate that spans almost six hectares in La Morra, Verduno, Roddi and Alba. This is a focused and tightly tuned wine with bright berry nuances and exciting crispness, length and elegance., 96.0, 99.0
US, , This is a tiny production wine in its third vintage that continues to impress—a deft concoction of dusty leather and pencil shavings that's elegantly structured and integrated. Red currant and clove add seasoning to ripe blackberry and dark chocolate flavors., 93.0, 65.0
US, Dutton Ranch Freestone Hill Vineyard, Extraordinary for how drinkable it is right now, and for how it will evolve. Shows the crisp acidity and minerality of this cool-climate vineyard, with rich flavors of raspberries, cherry liqueur, cola, exotic spices, vanilla, buttered cinnamon toast and smoky sandalwood. Yet the tannic integrity should help it change in fascinating ways over the next six years. Decant for several hours., 95.0, 58.0
Germany, Kiedrich Gräfenberg Beerenauslese, Initial whiffs of nuts and bruised apple blow away, revealing radiant aromas of marmalade and honey on this unctuous yet delicate wine. A shock of lemony acidity jolts the palate, but recovery comes quickly with plush peach and tangerine sweetness. The finish is silky smooth and endless., 93.0, 365.0
US, Block 24, This wine wears its 15.8% alcohol better than any similarly heady wine out there. Yes, it's a bit hot, but the heat comes across as a slight chili pepper edge to the blackberry and dark unsweetened chocolate flavors, and the wine is, in its own way, balanced and elegant. Hard to imagine a more perfect barbecue red., 90.0, 31.0
US, Reserve, Decent, but you'll do way better in Argentina, and save lots of bucks. Semi-unripe, with green, herb and cherry flavors., 83.0, 55.0
US, , Dark in color, this Pinot Noir is dry and somewhat heavy on the palate, with blackberry jam, plum and dark chocolate flavors that come with a touch of overripe raisin. Oak barrel aging brings sweet, toasty notes. Drink it now before the fruit fades., 85.0, 48.0
France, Procès Premier Cru, The first things to notice are the tannins with a strongly dry core. This wine is dark, dense and concentrated, still allowing red fruits and acidity to give freshness. It is a big, juicy wine with a great future. Drink from 2020., 94.0, 117.0
Italy, , This boats balanced structure, density and alcohol, with pretty aromatic renderings of cherry and spice. It's not too thick and chewy, but rather polished. It would pair nicely with breaded Milanese veal chops., 92.0, 124.0
Germany, Trittenheimer Apotheke Beerenauslese, Yes, this wine is supersweet, but it's also pristine in its clarity. Despite layers of honeyed richness, the aromas and flavors of lime and pineapple provide great energy and focus; there's even hints of slate-driven minerality on the nose and the long, mouthwatering finish., 94.0, 317.0
Austria, Loibner Steinertal Smaragd, This is a rich and complex wine that shows spiced pear and a tense structure. It is very aromatic and fresh while also rich and concentrated. A powerful statement of the fruit and minerality of the Wachau and definitely for long-term aging. Don't drink before 2016., 95.0, 68.0
Spain, Valdemoreda, Sweet, candied, minty and easygoing on the nose, then crisp and fresh in the mouth, with basic, stripped-down plum, berry and citrus flavors. Finishes fruity and fresh, with a mild candied sweetness., 84.0, 7.0
France, Lavaux Saint-Jacques Premier Cru, This wine has power and firm tannins. Intensely fresh, it offers acidity and red-currant flavors that burst out of the dark, dry core. It's complex, with a touch of spice from wood aging that gives an elegant, delicious aftertaste. Drink from 2019., 95.0, 168.0
Italy, Sperss, Gaja's Sperss was once a Barolo but now occupies a category all its own as a Nebbiolo from the Langhe region—the producer famously declassified his top wines. This shows extreme elegance and sophistication with fine nuances of forest fruit, spice, dried tobacco, licorice and Spanish cedar. The finish is long, polished and bright. Drink after 2020., 95.0, 268.0
France, Sélection de Grains Nobles, Supersweet, but never cloying, with acidity, pear skin tannins and delicate sweet brown sugar and honey flavors. It is a great example of how Loire Chenin manages to keep its balance and freshness while still offering long-aging botrytis character. Keep for at least 10 years., 93.0, 75.0
Italy, Colonnello, Barolo Colonnello is a determined, confident wine with a rich, succulent style and ripe aromas of blackberry, spice, sweet vanilla and polished black stone. The chewy mouthfeel also shows a precise stylistic choice and “the colonel” is richly opulent and enduring on the finish., 93.0, 175.0
US, Dry, Restrained both aromatically and on the palate, this Riesling offers modest hints of green apple and pear combined with a slightly herbal note. There's not a lot of complexity or concentration, but it's a brisk, refreshing wine., 82.0, 14.0
US, , Good, but a little lacking in depth and richness. The cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors are compromised by thinner notes of wintergreen and even a veggie touch., 85.0, 58.0
US, Melbury, Starts with a beautiful ruby color that's so pretty and gleaming. Appeals right away for its rich, attractive sour cherry candy, vanilla and anise aromas and flavors that are well-integrated with smoky oak. The tannins are firm, but ultra-refined, and the finish is entirely dry. A well-made, elegant wine of place that needs time. 2012–2018., 93.0, 275.0
US, , Beautiful, irresistable Syrah, lush and sweet in fruit and oak. Soft and velvety, it offers layers of puréed raspberries, cherries, blackberries, blueberries and chocolate, with a rich edge of toasted marshmallow, gingerbread and butterscotch. Yet it's dry, with modest alcohol., 94.0, 27.0
Spain, Altos Lanzaga, The last Altos that was this good came in 2004; this vintage is on a par with that superb wine courtesy of deep plum, mocha and marzipan aromas. This is a modern Rioja with impeccable balance despite being huge and tannic. Flavors of cassis, black cherry and dark plum operate off a mocha base, while the finish is toasty and chocolaty, with a note of black coffee. Best from 2015–2024., 94.0, 127.0
Italy, Altero, Very toasty upfront with a lot going on inside the glass. Cherry fruit is delivered with coffee bean, leather, cigar box, vanilla and a touch of Band-Aid. Has some rustic notes but an overall elegant mouthfeel with a long, velvety, supple finish. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd., 91.0, 82.0
US, Ramos Vineyard, This marks the debut of the Ramos Vineyard Chardonnay, inspired by a high-elevation site planted in 2001 by the late Bob Sessions and Jose Ramos, now director of vineyard operations. The wine paints a portrait of high-toned, elegant minerality accented by peach and lithe lemon. Capable of aging, it dances in acidity, with just a hint of caramel-vanilla on the finish. Made in tiny quantities, it's worth desperately seeking out., 95.0, 78.0
South Africa, , This light offering shows berry-cherry fruit and an herb note on the nose. The palate is even and dry with bing-cherry flavors, but an evident greenness keeps the wine from blossoming fully. Finishes dry, with a mildly astringent and slightly woody note., 84.0, 17.0
US, , A rewarding wine for its price, this bottling from winemaker Eric Johnson weaves accessible butter-crusted cherry pie and vanilla aromas with bright, nuanced touches of hibiscus, rose petal and mace on the nose. The palate unfolds in layers, mulberry and plum fruit giving way to crushed sage and roasted fennel notes, each as texturally compelling as the last., 92.0, 34.0
Italy, Vigna del Lago Riserva, Kicks off with a lot of maple, coffee and espresso, and in the mouth the tannins are spiky and aggressive. Nonetheless, there's dynamite classic fruit here and structure to burn. A classic Brunello with a rugged edge. Needs five to ten years on its side. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd., 92.0, 134.0
US, Cote a Cote, Darker than most of the wines in a big Rhône tasting, this dramatic Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre bottling is full-bodied and rich. It offers waves of chocolate and blackberries, with oak providing a smoky, butterscotchy overlay. Drink this soft, flamboyant wine now., 93.0, 85.0
Australia, Velvet Glove, Full-bodied, rich and chewy, this is a big, bold wine. Ample oak frames black cherry and cassis fruit, adding hints of vanilla and dark chocolate to the fudge-like impression. Warmth suffuses the palate, but doesn't quite progress to full-blown high-alcohol heat. There's no doubting its impressive intensity and ripeness. Drink now–2025., 93.0, 185.0
US, Ice Wine, A burnished gold, tilting toward mahogany, this decadently thrilling ice wine is sex in a glass. Immense concentration, with layers of sugar that run from molasses to honey to brown sugar to maple syrup. It's supported with enough acidity to keep it focused, and the flavors wrap into a finish that is a combination of every crème brûlée you've ever enjoyed., 94.0, 37.0
Italy, Tal Lùc, This is made from Verduzzo grapes and a tiny percentage of Riesling; the former variety gives the wine depth, substance, bright yellow-gold color and pretty aromas of butterscotch and caramel. The Riesling adds a touch of floral fragrance., 95.0, 88.0
France, Les Clos Grand Cru, The epitome of Grand Cru Chablis, this is mineral and fruit driven—impressive both from its richness and its tense structure. The power comes from the depth of flavor that brings the texture right through the wine. Age for 5–7 years., 94.0, 137.0
Germany, Johannisberg Wallhausen Erste Lage Trockenbeerenauslese, Aromas of mango and candied-orange rind lend a heady tropical feel to this concentrated TBA full of peach and marmalade flavors. Unctuous with sweet nectar, yet exquisitely dainty on the palate, it quivers with tangerine acidity and a finish that's laced with saffron and honey., 94.0, 237.0
US, , Simple, rustic and raw in acids, with semi-sweet blackberry and cherry jam flavors., 82.0, 24.0
US, The Classic Four, Cherry and cassis notes provide a touch of brighness on the nose and palate of this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Cabernet Franc, 26% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec, but its plum-raisin backdrop and dullness on the finish suggest it might be going downhill., 84.0, 27.0
France, Schoenenbourg Grand Cru, The lifted nose seems like an amalgam of chalk and dried apples along with lemon zest. The aromas are reminiscent of evolving Riesling but this is not the only grape in this expressive and highly aromatic field blend. While there is distinct residual sweetness on the palate, this has a counterweight in the rich texture of the midpalate. There is something authentic and deeply comforting and satisfying at the core of this wine that says Alsace. It's impossible to put this wine into a box, it needs to be tasted and enjoyed on its very own terms. The finish is medium sweet, totally soil-driven and very, very long. This is an experience rather than a drink. Drink now through 2035., 95.0, 98.0
US, Amparo, Malbec has been a shining star at this winery, but this bottling is the best yet. Estate grown, big and fruity, this wine is generously soaked in barrel flavors of spice and toast, cocoa and Bourbon. Lush and juicy, the fruit more than holds its own, and it's nearly irresistible., 94.0, 47.0
US, Reserve, A distinguished Cabernet, rich in fruit and impeccably oaked. But it's young. There's a fresh, jammy taste to the blackberries, cassis and dark chocolate, and the tannins are brisk and fuzzy. Don't drink it until at least 2015, and it should develop for years afterward., 93.0, 95.0
France, , This is a deeply rich, very impressive wine from a great white-wine vintage. It's concentrated with the essence of pure Chardonnay. It has tension along with a full texture. Age it for at least 10 years., 95.0, 398.0
Spain, Aurus, Aurus defines awesome modern Rioja. The nose is floral and decked out with wild berry aromas, marzipan, vanilla and hard spices. The palate is powerful and tannic, with bold cassis, raspberry, cherry, coffee and chocolate flavors. Beautifully crafted and with a nice red fruit element courtesy of 15% Graciano to go with old vines Tempranillo. Drink from 2012–2021., 94.0, 247.0
Italy, Cannubi Boschis, The Cannubi Boschis cru (also known as Monghisolfo) is known for the excellent quality of its fruit. This expression is particularly austere and elegant and would fit appropriately in a gentleman's smoking room or other such formal context. The aromas recall old leather, cigar box, dried rose petal and dried figs. Very interesting, very tight and firm., 93.0, 195.0
France, La Comtesse, A floral, tropical fruit-influenced wine that is round in character and full of wonderfully opulent fruit. The final acidity stays within the ripe fruit character., 92.0, 44.0
France, Dom Ruinart Brut Rosé, Pale pink in color, this is stylish rosé. It has the intense acidity of the 1996 vintage, meaning that it still tastes young, crisp, vibrant. The only suggestion that this is 14 years old is in the slight toastiness. But it should go on for many more years., 93.0, 295.0
Germany, Rosa-Goldlack Beerenauslese, With scents of dried apricots and superconcentrated pear nectar, one sniff suggests this is going to be a sumptuously sweet treat. And it is. Pear, melon and spice flavors linger elegantly on the finish, ending long and sweet., 93.0, 395.0
US, Diamond Reserve, There are some tough, astringent tannins in this wine that make it harsh on the palate and bitter on the finish. The actual flavors are of cola, raisins and black currants. Doesn't seem like an ager., 84.0, 37.0
Germany, Hattenheimer Wisselbrunnen Beerenauslese, The flight of Rheingau dessert wines this appeared in was almost universally disappointing. Like most of the others, this showed some excessively earthy aromas and flavors, although it did possess ample sweetness and attractive musk and spice notes., 84.0, 137.0
US, , This Cab is starting to turn raisiny and pruny, and hot in alcohol as well, with a porty taste and a finish that's bitter in tannins., 83.0, 85.0
France, , A huge, powerful, dense wine, which layers pure black fruits over dusty tannins. This is an impressive wine, proof of Rauzan-Ségla's improvements since Chanel took over ownership. It is packed with fruits, like an intense jelly, but also has dryness, acidity and good aging potential., 94.0, 57.0
France, , A firmly structured wine, packed with fruit, acidity and complex tannins. It is powerful, dark and rich with great weight to balance the dry, smoky character from wood aging. It's impressive, concentrated with a touch of licorice and spice that  cuts through the acidity. Drink from 2020., 94.0, 257.0
US, , This seems so sweet, it's practically a Port dessert wine. It's soft and simple, with chocolate and blackberry jam flavors., 82.0, 34.0
US, Reserve, Massive fruity extract characterizes this Cabernet. With noble tannins and explosive black currant, cassis and dark chocolate flavors, it defines the modern Napa cult style of soft, delicious complexity. Good to go now, but you're better off holding it for 8–12 years., 93.0, 106.0
US, Clarissa Vin Rouge, Dry and rough in texture, with berry, cherry, tobacco, herb and spice flavors wrapped into edgy, slightly green tannins. Turns sharp on the finish, and not likely to age., 84.0, 47.0
Italy, Lodovico, Aromas of graphite, black currant, plum, cedar, blue flowers and tobacco emerge from this full-bodied red. Made with Cabernet Franc and a drop of Petit Verdot, the structured palate offers blackberries, licorice, clove and a toasted note alongside velvety tannins. It shows great finesse, especially for the torrid 2011 vintage. Drink 2016–2026., 95.0, 419.0
France, Les Preuses Grand Cru, This is powerful, typical of Les Preuses. White and yellow fruits are important to the palate, but so are rich, honeyed toast, minerality and an opulent, intense concentration. This is impressive, elegance with power, and worth aging for several years., 94.0, 67.0
US, Gran Spumante, Frankly sweet, and zesty in acidity, this is a nice, clean bubbly for those who like a bit of sugar in the finish. It has pleasant flavors of tangerine and vanilla, with a light, delicate mouthfeel., 85.0, 9.0
New Zealand, , The 2008 vintage wasn't an easy one in Marlborough, but Ivan Sutherland and James Healy (both formerly of Cloudy Bay) have turned in an excellent effort. Even after almost four years, the wine remains dark and vibrant in color, with bold black cherry fruit accented by hints of plum and coffee. Tannins are soft and acids crisp, making it a wine to enjoy over the next few years., 90.0, 41.0
US, Seduce, Lots of good flavor in this dry wine, with blackberries, black currants and herbs. But it's very hard in tannins, with a drily astringent mouthfeel that no amount of age is likely to mitigate., 84.0, 57.0
Italy, , This gorgeous Chianti Classico boasts lively cherry, strawberry and violet aromas. The mouthwatering palate shows concentrated wild-cherry flavor layered with mint, white pepper and clove. It has fresh acidity and firm tannins that will develop complexity with more bottle age. A textbook Chianti Classico., 93.0, 16.0
France, Les Champgains Premier Cru, Situated in the center of the premier crus of Puligny, Champgains produces an elegant, textured wine. This bottling, with the warmth of 2013 behind it, is fragrant with white fruits and has a soft aftertaste. It needs to age to bring it out its more complex character, so wait until 2018., 90.0, 141.0
Spain, Oloroso Viejo, A serious and intense wine, with coffee and mocha on the nose, and a sharp dried-apricot and toasted-nut character on the palate. Power is this wine's calling card, as it hits like a bomb. The flavors are huge, the mouthfeel big but balanced. This is aged Oloroso in top form., 93.0, 116.0
Australia, , Bright and limey, with butterscotch notes punctuating the citrus fruit. The crisp palate is light-to-medium- bodied and winds up on a fleeting mineral note. Try with halibut. Best now to 2011., 85.0, 19.0
Germany, Herrenberg Eiswein 82, Dark, almost russet in color, this is an eiswein that's definitely out of the ordinary, with notes of fusty library, walnut, dried apricots and figs that come across as a bit syrupy in texture. It seems a bit advanced compared to other eisweins, but it will likely remain at this plateau for decades., 93.0, 316.0
US, , True to the dense, muscular style of Woodward Canyon's Merlots, this elevates the complexity in a near-perfect vintage. Deep and textural, it packs together concentrated red fruits, preserves and cassis. At first it shows a little heat from the 15% alcohol, but as it breathes open over hours (and even days) the primary fruit gives way to subtle veins of olive, earth, coffee and toast., 95.0, 39.0
France, Cabernet Sauvignon, The tannins and the black currant flavors leave no doubt about the varietal origin of this straightforward, well-made, fresh wine., 83.0, 6.0
Germany, Forster Kirchenstück Beerenauslese 375 ml, Hugely sweet and decadent, this is a tour de force of botrytized winemaking. Honeyed citrus aromas are buoyed by hints of perfume and spice, with dried apricot flavors accented by spiced honey. Mouthcoating, rich and impossibly long, this wine should easily age for 40 or more years., 95.0, 239.0
Argentina, Apartado, Apartado, a high-flying Bordeaux blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, shows up only occasionally, but when it does it shines. This vintage is stunning; the black cherry and wild berry flavors are lively and honest, while the wine's structure is just where it should be. With a juicy steak or lamb chops, this wine will bowl you over., 92.0, 64.0
US, Estate, This rare Walla Walla-grown Sauvignon Blanc is superbly balanced, with rich, ripe, round, full-bodied fruit flavors anchored by defining acidity. From the Woodward Canyon estate vineyard, it conjures up a farmers' market of mixed stone fruits and melon, adding candied orange peel highlights to a lingering finish., 93.0, 26.0
Austria, Saz Ruster Ausbruch, This blend of Furmint and Gelber Muskateller—the traditional blend for Ruster Ausbruch—is a refreshingly delicate wine, showing delicious apricot freshness as well as the proper honeyed touch. The acidity powers through the wine, promising great aging potential as well as making it delicious to drink now., 94.0, 87.0
US, Chico's Run Doña Margarita Vineyard, A very successful Pinot Noir that shows the splendid characteristics of grapes well grown in the far Sonoma Coast, on famed Goldridge soils. Acidity marks it, crisp and vital and nervy. Yet wrapped into the silky mouthfeel are rich, elaborate cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper cola, pomegranate, persimmon and sandalwood flavors that are intricate as a tapestry. A great wine that should develop bottle complexities over the next eight years., 95.0, 49.0
France, , This is a ripe Pinot Noir, with a firm and solid structure and a very dense character. It has concentration and a great depth of flavor; the blacks fruits and tannins cut into the heart of the wine. Age for at least seven years., 94.0, 187.0
France, , Faiveley owns two acres of this large Grand Cru vineyard. This 2011 is a big, bold and fruity wine that shows red fruits, a sweet texture and good acidity. It's powerful and dark, jammy as well as structured. The wood flavors are still showing strongly and need to soften. Drink from 2019., 93.0, 226.0
US, Estate Bottled, Funky and intriguing on the nose, this proffers scents of narcissus and farmyard, with touches of char and dark fruit. Medium bodied, this has an open texture, with integrated acids and malleable tannins. Flavors of tart blackberry candy, leather and Dr. Pepper surface on the palate., 85.0, 39.0
Italy, , This organic wine from the scorching 2003 vintage is definitely past its prime with a brownish hue and tired aromas of resin and very ripe fruit. It's just short of cooked, but the aromas do recall jam and black fruit marmalade. The wine is thin and compact in texture with lingering notes of dark chestnut and spice., 83.0, 16.0
US, Ferrington Vineyard, Even in its extreme youth, this lovely Pinot shows a supple elegance that's almost drinkable now. Almost, but not quite. The tannins are ripe and smooth but thick, and the young raspberry, cherry and tangerine fruit needs time to develop and mesh with the oak. But it's a beautiful wine, Williams Selyem's best Ferrington in memory, and a near-perfect expression of Anderson Valley Pinot Noir. Hold until late 2008., 95.0, 59.0
France, Petite Chapelle Premier Cru, From vines just below the line of Grand Cru vineyards, this is a big and powerful expression of Pinot Noir. It is dense with firm tannins that are embedded in the ripe black fruits. It's a complex wine, serious while still fruity, and needing to age. Drink from  2018., 94.0, 97.0
France, , Still very young, this is showing the proper staying power of a powerful wine. The structure is complex and dense, the plum and cranberry fruits are wrapped in tannins and hints of wood. The wine powers through the palate, promising long-term aging. A great success for the vintage., 95.0, 259.0
US, Estate Selection Block S, There have been Estate Selection Chards from Cuvaison before, but never a block bottling. This wine fully merits its status and price. Tightly angular and acidic in youth, it's very minerally, with a gunmetal tang to the oak-infused Meyer lemon, green apple and green pear flavors. One of the rare California Chardonnays not ready on release, this Chablis-style wine will be best in mid-2008, and should develop for another few years., 93.0, 36.0
Italy, , Fragrant and intense, Bertani's 2003 Amarone delivers enticing aromas of spice, cola, mature berry fruit and smoke. You'll feel power in the mouth—although the wine's alcohol is beautifully integrated—and a long, satisfying finish., 93.0, 136.0
Germany, Erdener Prälat GG Reserve Alte Reben Trocken, Two years of aging on the lees renders incredible textural dimension to this decadently silky dry Riesling. Fresh white grapefruit, lime and lemon notes shine on the palate, offsetting expansive mouthfeel, with acidity that's focused and precise. Stunning already, but should evolve dramatically through 2025., 93.0, 236.0
US, , Soft and jammy, this Pinot has pie-filling flavors of cherries, rapsberries and blackberries. In fact, you can throw in the pie crust, too, with its buttery, smoky, vanilla and toasted dough taste. Seems heavy for a coastal Pinot, especially at this price., 85.0, 49.0
Italy, Flauto Magico Riserva, This opens with subdued aromas of espresso, grilled herb, scorched underbrush and French oak. The lean evolved palate shows roasted coffee bean, a hint of oak-driven spice and a salty note but the fruit has already dried up, leaving an abrupt, astringent finish., 85.0, 149.0
Portugal, 30-year old tawny, This impressively concentrated wine has classic burnt caramel aromas, with dense, fig and bitter chocolate flavors. It is rich, delicious and tastes somewhat older than its 30-year label., 92.0, 174.0
France, , Dark and structured, this is a firm wine. It has a smoky wood character, powerful tannins over intensely ripe fruit. Acidity and sweetness balance to give a dense wine, powered with richness and destined to age for many years., 95.0, 69.0
US, Saggio, There are some interesting notes of earth and bramble in this everything- but-the-kitchen-sink blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cab Franc, Syrah and Sangiovese, but unfortunately they're dominated by notes of dried herbs and stalky green., 83.0, 26.0
US, Roger Rose Vineyard, The nose on this single-vineyard wine from a strong, often overlooked appellation is tight and minerally before showing a slightly tropical kiwi element. Brightly acidic on the lively palate, flavors range from Key lime and Meyer lemon to pear skins and apple flesh., 91.0, 2013.0
Italy, Terminum, Incredible aromatic intensity opens the amazing bouquet of this Gewürztraminer-based dessert wine. You'll recognize flavors of candied orange, jasmine, crème caramel and toasted almond. The wine is smooth, thick and very persistent overall., 94.0, 108.0
Austria, Vinothek, From Nikolaihof's reserve library collection, this is living, vivid proof of the aging ability of Grüner Veltliner. The wine is still fresh, a lively line of acidity giving bite and shape to flavors of fresh almonds, dried fruits and a rounded final caramel taste. This is a wine to savor, to sip and relish., 94.0, 208.0
US, The Flyer, This Pinot tastes so oaky, it's like chewing on barrel staves. Notes of vanilla, buttered toast and the creamy-sweet flavor of oak sap completely overwhelm what otherwise seems like a good wine. This is a real outlier among MacPhail's other 2010 Pinot Noirs., 85.0, 59.0
US, Melville Vineyard, One sniff of this terrific Pinot Noir, and your brain knows it's the good stuff. From the ruby color to the fresh, jammy plum, cherry, cola and beef jerky flavors, it's just a terrific wine. Enormously complex and velvety in the mouth, it should improve over the next four years., 93.0, 46.0
Spain, Prado Enea Gran Reserva, Alluring, complex and powerful aromas of grilled meat, berries, tea, smoke, vanilla and spice cover every base. An intense palate is concentrated but still elegant. Blackberry, molasses and mocha flavors finish with chocolaty oak notes, fine tannins and overall cohesion. Drink this special Rioja from 2020 through 2035., 95.0, 79.0
France, , Rich and finely perfumed, this has a ripe black-fruit flavor, with notes of fresh red berries. It is full bodied and round, with just the right level of ripeness and weight to lend excellent aging potential., 93.0, 246.0
Germany, Rüdesheimer Berg Rottland Beerenauslese, Supersweet and cloying, with one-dimensional honey and barley-sugar aromas and flavors. Disappointing., 84.0, 197.0
US, Stone's Throw Vineyard Estate Grown, Nefarious just keeps going from strength to strength. This marvelous, off-dry Riesling, from an estate vineyard just outside the Lake Chelan AVA, is built upon delicately-woven threads of lemon, orange, apricot and cantaloupe, with a smattering of spun sugar. The flavors keep piling on, with caramel and honey coating the finish., 94.0, 18.0
Italy, Pergole Vece, You'll notice a unique and terroir-driven note of freshly milled white peppercorn that distinguishes this Amarone. In the background are generous tones of berry, black mineral and toasted almond. Pair this extraordinary wine with roasted meat or aged cheese., 94.0, 118.0
France, Génération XIX, The current Alphonse Mellot is the 19th to bear the name, always passed in the family from father to son. Made from 80-year-old vines, aged on the lees before bottling, the wine has a fine concentration, giving generosity, a hint of yeastiness, spice, pink grapefruit and even a final burst of opulence., 92.0, 84.0
Spain, , A wine searching for an identity. The nose deals menthol, licorice, grilled meat and molasses but little-to-no bright fruit. That heaviness transfers to the mouth, where marinated, baked flavors mix with green tomato. Fails to impress., 83.0, 36.0
US, Old Vines, Pure Cabernet from some of Washington's oldest vines at Champoux and Sagemoor, this is a superb bottle, dense, compact and textural. A full mix of black fruits underscored with clean, moist earth and polished, silky tannins, finishes with pretty barrel flavors of spice and vanilla. Broad, deep and immensely pleasurable., 95.0, 89.0
US, Hyde Vineyards, What a great aroma this wine has: refined oak and all the smoky, vanilla trimmings, framing pineapple, orange rind and lemon custard aromas and flavors. This massive Chard just gives off oodles of fruit. It is balanced with rich, brilliant acidity., 93.0, 56.0
Chile, Tradition, A bit dense, with prune and mint aromas. Limited in scope and depth; what's here is deep but monotone. Flavors of boysenberry and black plum are heavy and soft, while chocolate brings up the rear. Short in structure and tannins, but dense enough to match a rich weeknight dinner., 84.0, 8.0
France, Le Rognet, Hinting at opulence to come, this is a rich wine. Its tannins are powerful but do not detract from the ripe berry and stone fruits. It has a fine, balanced texture with the sweetness of the fruit lifted by delicious acidity. Give this wine five years at least., 93.0, 156.0
France, Les Cazetiers Premier Cru, A big, bold wine, its fruits etched richly against the ripe tannins and spice. The sweet fig and plum flavors are balanced well with the refreshing raspberry juice acidity. A fine, dark wine that will age for several years., 93.0, 256.0
US, Il Passito Late Harvest, Very sweet, with honeyed flavors of apricots, peaches and vanilla crème brûlée, but lacks the acidity a sweet wine needs for liveliness., 85.0, 79.0
Austria, Gaisberg Reserve, Still shy but invitingly soft, it has a charming peachiness that cushions both the lemony acidity and the streak of stony minerality. Edges of mandarin peel and flesh add to the allure, which will increase with age. Softly-spoken but very convincing and long., 94.0, 28.0
France, L'Eminence, Ripe, smooth and gold in color, this is a nectar-like wine. It has a honeyed note and a dry edge from botrytis, with an opulent, complex texture. It also has lively acidity that offers the purest expression of Petit Manseng. A great wine to drink at the end of a meal, or with a rich terrine at the start., 94.0, 128.0
Italy, Pergole Vece Riserva, Black plum, blue flower, oak, espresso and chocolate aromas waft from the glass of this densely structured wine. The palate delivers blueberry extract, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and spice alonside tightly packed wood tannins that generate an astringent, mouth-drying finish. Give it time to unwind. Drink 2018–2030., 90.0, 151.0
US, Statement, This one-of-a-kind offering from Chehalem celebrates what they are calling a “great” vintage. The wine is dark, supple and immensely rich and dense, yet retains a lightness that captures the elegance of the Pinot Noir grape while propelling it to rarified heights. The mix of red and purple fruits, herb, spice and earth all come together in a smooth and seductive wine that drinks like a dream., 95.0, 99.0
US, Estate Bottled, A magical blend of 93% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Petit Verdot and 2% Cabernet Franc, this estate-crafted blend exudes elegance, etching out silos of herb, lavender, cedar and earth around savory-laced texture. A powerful concentration of dark chocolate appears on the lengthy finish, the wine sourced from dry-farmed, impeccably tended vines. Cellar through 2027., 95.0, 199.0
France, , Rich and full-bodied, the flavors of quince and pear are balanced by great acidity. It is a big, powerful wine that, with its tight fruit and steely background, promises long aging. The tropical fruits also need several years to show strongly. Drink from 2018., 94.0, 428.0
France, Clos Paradis, Made from old vines in a single vineyard, very intense even in its youth. It has a smooth, creamy texture over a core of flint and herbaceousness. It gradually builds, offering green and white fruits and vibrant acidity. This is a beautiful wine., 91.0, 23.0
US, , This is a white Bordeaux wannabe, barrel fermented and rich in citrus, fig, spicy melon and smoky flavors, but it's a little too soft and candied., 84.0, 18.0
France, Heimbourg Turckheim Vendange Tardive, Orange marmalade aromas set the scene for a fresh, intensely sweet wine. It has rich flavors of tropical fruit and coconut, but the acidity still ensures that the wine is in balance.However, it will continue to develop. Try again in 2015., 91.0, 123.0
France, La Romanée Premier Cru, Big and rounded, this will eventually develop into a ripe, complex wine. Spice and toast notes merge with the yellow fruits and structured nervosity., 92.0, 94.0
Portugal, , As ever, Vesuvio is packed with its generous, opulent ripe fruit, showing richness, dense flavors, layers of jam and sweetness with a hint of caramel flavors. This is a Port for indulgence, ripe, rich and packed with flavor., 93.0, 66.0
Austria, Heiligenstein Erste Lage, This is a pure, aesthetic wine, delicately outlined and shaped. With its citrus flavors, crisp lines and tight, taut acidity, it shows both great minerality and a sharp final focus on fruit and structure. Age this wine, and don't drink before 2017., 94.0, 38.0
Italy, 500ml, From the 2003 vintage, this sweet red wine shows well evolved aromas of candied fruit, prune, black raisin, exotic spice and barbecue wood. The wine sports tight, gritty tannins and soft, jammy sweetness on the close., 85.0, 99.0
US, The First Date, Sugary sweet in lemon and lime, pineapple, papaya and vanilla custard flavors, with good, balancing acidity. Basically a dessert wine. Roussanne and Marsanne., 84.0, 28.0
US, , An interesting and different Syrah, and a promising release from a young brand to watch. The wine is very high in acidity, giving it a firm grip. The flavors are tremendously rich, offering a tsunami of blackberries, currants, plum sauce, baker's chocolate, leather, grilled meat, pine nut and black pepper. It's youthfully aggressive right now in tannins, and needs time for all the serious parts to marry. Leave it alone until sometime in 2010, and it should haul for years after., 94.0, 48.0
Germany, Berncasteler Doctor Spätlese, Prospective purchasers should bear in mind that this wine was harvested at sugar levels far beyond the minimum spätlese requirements. This is more of a big auslese or small beerenauslese in terms of sugar and style, marrying dried apricot aromas with notes of candied pineapple and spice. It's very sweet and honeyed, and would be cloying were it not for its firm acid backbone. This can be cellared for 20 years. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC., 93.0, 76.0
France, , Big and showy, with an ripe, opulent feel, this is all about dark fruits and firm tannins. Flavors of black cherries and plums are balanced by the acidity, all rolled together into a structure that's powerful and seriously age-worthy., 94.0, 248.0
Spain, Malleolus de Valderramiro, Big and sultry as always, with bacon, smoke, black fruit and a full rack of spices making for a wonderful bouquet. Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors. And then comes tobacco and more spice on the finish, which is grabby but understandable because it's so young. Best from 2012 through 2019., 93.0, 176.0
Argentina, Reserva, The nose is a dark, clumsy confluence of rubber, stewed cherry and horseradish, and the palate is both tangy and bouncy, with a hard feel and plenty of acidic kick. Misses too many marks to rate better., 81.0, 13.0
Italy, Cinque Stelle Ca' del Pipa, This is a generous wine that embraces your senses on all fronts. Penetrating aromas include cherry preserves, cola, black mineral and cedar. You'll taste sweet fruit, which is carried over the wine's soft and long-lasting mouthfeel., 92.0, 105.0
US, Proprietor's Reserve, If you are a fan of Rosenblum Zins, you might want to try this Washington Zin, styled in the same 16.4% alcohol mode. It's got plenty of syrupy berry fruit, and some very chocolaty streaks as well, but the tannins are earthy and still have a bitter finish to them. The winery's regular Zin is far better., 84.0, 38.0
Spain, Aro, Opaque and nearly over the top, with concentrated, roasted aromas of baked blackberry and dark plums. Super big and weighty, with driving flavors and some of the same lemony oak displayed by the Torre Muga 2005. Finishes in a mass of fudge, black olive and roasted berries. Hold until 2011–12, then drink., 92.0, 205.0
Austria, Zöbinger Heiligenstein Lyra, One of Bründlmayer's specialities is the lyre training system, which opens out the canopy to get the maximum exposure. It gives a wine that has extra intensity, flavors of white currants vying with lychees, almonds, a perfumed aura. The end is satisfying, with acidity adding a lift., 94.0, 58.0
France, Fourchaume Premier Cru, A finely rounded wine, with lovely ripe peach and pineapple fruits, lifted by a dash of lemon juice. Finely balanced, ripe in character, although always textured and tangy. There is a mouthwatering finish., 91.0, 33.0
US, Cepage, A beautiful Bordeaux blend, soft and intricately detailed, with something for everyone. Fruit fans will like the array of blackberries, cherries and raspberries, and oak lovers will appreciate the sweet, caramelized smokiness. The tannins are rich and furry, and the finish lasts for a long time. Drink now–2013., 93.0, 86.0
US, Kastania Vineyard, This single-vineyard Pinot doesn't have the firm dryness you expect of a Pinot Noir from this appellation, but instead collapses in sugary, simple raspberry and cherry jelly flavors. Regains a point or two for silkiness., 84.0, 48.0
France, , The aromas of dried fruits do not show the sweetness and unctuousness of this ripe, botrytized wine. It has sweet honey flavors, spice, orange peel and a pure streak of acidity. This wine can age well, but it could also be drunk this year. Screwcap., 94.0, 68.0
US, Old Vine, One of the “12 Zins of Lodi 2014,” it was chosen in a judging by the Lodi Winegrape Commission to represent the region's finest. The deep red-black color is saturated to the rim. Deep, evocative aromas lead to ripe cherry, boysenberry, chocolate and nutmeg flavors that echo on the finish. The texture is full and smooth., 92.0, 15.0
US, Nicole's, This wine is a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Malbec. It shows the big, hard tannins of both varieties, as well as their dryness and intense blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors. The 100% new French oak is in balance with the size of the underlying fruit. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015, and it should still be providing pleasure in 2021., 92.0, 115.0
US, Hillside Select, Young, tannic and juicy, filled with sweet blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors, and well oaked, having been aged in 100% new French barrels. Those are the raw facts. The wine itself shows the pedigree of this fine estate, and will no doubt pick up bottle nuances over the years. But it seems to lack the precision of the great 2001, 2003 and 2004 vintages. Try after 2012., 92.0, 215.0
Italy, Prephylloxera La Vigna di Don Peppino, Mount Etna's Don Peppino vineyard is responsible for some of the volcano's most precious and highest quality fruit. This wine opens with a light hue and delicate aromas of violets, white almonds, cranberries and fresh plums. The nose is polished and refined. It's hard to believe that sucha violent volcano can produce such a feminine wine., 93.0, 96.0
US, Bleu Saphir, Sharp, green acids and tannins mar what is otherwise a fine Bordeaux blend. The blackberry and cherry flavors, which are well-oaked, have a tough, minty edge that detracts. Drink now., 84.0, 58.0
Australia, Liandra, This is sexy stuff that proprietor Roman Bratasiuk says is “more Côte-Rôtie” than his other Syrahs. Its perfumed nose offers up hints of violets and cracked pepper to go along with raspberry fruit, while it's supple in the mouth—almost too easy—with pretty mixed berry flavors and a nib of bitter chocolate. Long and elegant on the finish. Drink now–2015., 94.0, 78.0
US, , This tastes like an inexpensive Merlot you opened a few days ago and left on the kitchen counter. It's soft and simple, and the cherry fruit turns dry and stale., 81.0, 23.0
Portugal, , A sweet, soft, clean wine, anonymous almost. Yes, there is freshness, lightness, but all the time the awkward, unbalancing sweetness pulls it down. Drink very chilled., 82.0, 5.0
Portugal, , Starts off a bit floral and toasty, but the blueberry-scented fruit quickly asserts itself. Masses of soft, ripe fruit come through on the palate, along with a rich, dense, mouthfeel and soft but plentiful tannins., 91.0, 43.0
Portugal, Quinta São Luis Vintage, Dark in color, with spice and some concentration. The wine, though, is spoiled by volatility and a huge and unbalancing acidity. Nor is the spirit really integrated., 84.0, 68.0
US, , A captivating Chard that shows impeccable balance, and the price is very good for this level of quality. The fruit is brilliantly ripe in green apple, kiwi, Asian pear and lime flavors, with a deft touch of smoky oak. A firm minerality undergirds the structure., 92.0, 25.0
Spain, 2V Premium, Roasted meat, leather, animal and stout berry aromas make for an inviting bouquet. Like most serious Toro wines, this is hard but fresh and layered, with lively black-fruit flavors that darken under the control of oaky spice. Tobacco, menthol and mint ring loudly on the finish. Drink now–2018; 200 cases made., 91.0, 143.0
Italy, Bricco Rocche Brunate, Thanks to its dense clay soils, the Brunate cru delivers wines with high color saturation and aromatic caliber. This Barolo offers layers of black fruit, plum, spice, tobacco, cola and dark chocolate. The wine is firm and finely textured with power, dimension and personality on the long finish., 94.0, 88.0
US, Cambium, Muted black plum teases from the nose of this wine, a blend of 73% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. Amidst a wall of dusty tannins still needing time to soften, you'll find clove, blackberry and a treasure trove of chocolate and vanilla., 92.0, 125.0
US, Reserve, A great Cab showcasing everything good about Napa's fabulous '01 Cabs. It's rich, vibrant and complex, with layers of cassis, cocoa and roasted coffee flavors, and a deft touch of smoky oak. The tannins are sweet, ripe and subtle. Doesn't clobber you sideways with fruit, but offers elegant, sophisticated drinking., 93.0, 107.0
Italy, Arcanum I, With burnt popcorn as the lead scent and an herbal streak that can't be denied, Kendall-Jackson's attempt at Tuscan Cabernet Franc (with 18% Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiove) requires too much sacrifice. The flavors are of rhubarb and raspberry, with spice and tomato sauce along for the ride. Has size and potency, but not much charm., 83.0, 96.0
France, , A top-notch effort from a difficult vintage, Chave's 2004 red Hermitage is a complete wine: complex and balanced. Spice, meat and red fruit aromas and flavors swirl together in a mix of power and elegance. Acids are a touch crisp, but that's the vintage speaking. Drink 2010–2025., 94.0, 98.0
France, , While the wood aromas dominate, on the palate, there is a much richer, rounder character. This wine, with its huge fruit, white peach flavors, layers of wood and citrus, is just waiting to burst out of its youth. Delicious ripeness and acidity lend balance, while the oak needs some time to calm down and mature., 94.0, 198.0
Spain, Don José Oloroso, Nutty and intense, like peanut brittle reduced to liquid form—but with less than half the corn syrup. It delivers beautiful texture and intensity; it's almost fruity, but then mushroom, almond and macadamia nut take over. With perfect weight and a finish that doesn't quit, this is a great dry Sherry. Imported by Shaw-Ross International Importers., 93.0, 17.0
Chile, Medalla Real Special Reserve, Basic Cabernet Sauvignon, with all its goods up front. Opens with some nice cassis aromatics but there’s just not much on the palate. The finish is short and there’s a greenness to the fruit that reflects the tremendous difficulty of the 1998 vintage. Not up to previous efforts., 82.0, 15.0
Austria, Ried Mariental, A huge, powered wine from the famed Mariental vineyard, smoothed by wood, but also packed with dark tannins, flavors of dark plums, bitter chocolate and blackberry fruits. The tannins—dry and firm—promise great aging potential. Keep this wine for 5 years and more. Glass stopper., 93.0, 117.0
Australia, Reserve, For consumers used to Barossa-style Shiraz, this will prove an interesting diversion. The aromas and flavors are crisper and spicier, ranging from floral notes and blueberry to star anise and stone fruit. It's round in the mouth and lushly textured, yet not unstructured, suggesting 10 or more years of ageability, although it is delicious now., 92.0, 35.0
US, Reserve, This big, bold blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Petit Verdot and smaller amounts of Malbec and Merlot is powerfully built, with firm, integrated tannins that feel chalky and dusty. Black currant and cherry flavors dominate, with waves of tobacco and dark chocolate leading to a soft, lingering finish. This will cellar well, to be enjoyed 2023–2028., 92.0, 135.0
US, , A harsh, disagreeable wine. So high in acidity, it's sour, and the finish is sweet and hot., 81.0, 33.0
France, Brut Rosé, Also tasted out of magnum, although the price listed is for a single bottle. This rivals the '85, delivering great complexity and a rich, round mouthfeel., 92.0, 235.0
France, Clos des Mouches Premier Cru, This rich, powerful and juicy wine is just bursting out of its wood aging bounds. It has opulent red-berry flavors, a core of firm tannins and intense acidity. Ripe and fruity, this is full of aging potential., 94.0, 109.0
US, Wildcreek Canyon, This is a reliable Cabernet, and the price makes it especially attractive. Gets the job done with full-bodied flavors of blackberries and sweet, toasty oak., 83.0, 7.0
Australia, Dry Bore, A terrific value, this boasts knockout aromas of blueberry pie and cracked pepper, followed by a velvety, rich texture and flavors that pick up hints of additional spice, grilled meat and black olive. It juxtaposes ripeness, texture and complexity to make a complete package worth cellaring until 2010 and drinking over the following 10 years., 93.0, 27.0
US, , Black pepper and bright cherry on the nose lead into flavors of red berry, cherry and smoke. The restraint is elegant but may be a touch overshot—one wants more from this wine. Pair with poultry and lighter dishes., 82.0, 25.0
Australia, The Noble Wrinkled, Lovely dessert-style Riesling at an extremely attractive price. It yields dried apricot aromas, then turns to honeyed marmalade in the mouth, just loaded with orange-apricot preserves. It's weighty and viscous, with a long, sweet finish. Should last through at least 2016., 94.0, 19.0
France, Les Combettes Premier Cru, The most well known of Puligny's premier cru vineyards, Les Combettes is at the very heart of the slope. This central position shows in this dense and concentrated wine that's big, powerful and marked by fresh fruit-salad flavors of green figs, green apple and spice. The whole is borne up by a fine, solid structure of wood and tannins., 94.0, 119.0
US, Yountville Selection, Tough, vegetal, tannic and raspingly dry, and not going anywhere. A huge disappointment. Tasted twice., 82.0, 125.0
US, Portola Springs Vineyard, There's a minerality to this Chard that makes it bracing, although it also shows the opulence of Fogarty's other '04s. A tang of gunmetal undergirds the tropical fruit and vanilla custard flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture. Almost begs for shrimp, lobster, crab, the more richly prepared, the better., 92.0, 45.0
France, Aux Malconsorts Premier Cru, A tannins-dominated wine, firm and dry. The fruit is relatively subdued, with a juicy character of raspberries, red plum skins and crisp acidity. This is a wine that needs aging to soften those tannins: give it 4–5 years., 92.0, 145.0
US, , Soft scents of dryer sheets, lemons, tropical fruits and white flowers mark this Pinot Gris. On entrance, this light-to medium-bodied wine feels loose and flat, but the acidity picks up on the finish to give it a final lift., 83.0, 17.0
US, Freedom Hill Vineyard, The biggest production and lowest priced of all the winery's vineyard designates, this is sexy, substantial and one of the best offerings from any winery sourcing fruit from this exceptional vineyard. A riot of berries, plums and Asian spices fills the mouth—well-integrated, layered and detailed right on through the extended finish. A light dusting of cocoa powder lingers and invites the next sip., 93.0, 37.0
France, Les Folatières, A gorgeously ripe wine, its rounded yellow fruits tempered by wood aging. There is a mineral core, with a steely character to go with the pure pleasures of the rich fruit. The wine is fruity now, and does need to age to bring out the rest of its complex flavors., 93.0, 137.0
Spain, Viñas de Olivara, Lively, candied and medicinal, with grassy aromas along with mild animal notes. The palate is young, grabby, forceful but solid, while the flavors are bright, bold, snappy and suggest red plum and black cherry. A basic young wine that's decent if you're not too discerning., 84.0, 9.0
US, Parsons' Vineyard, A Syrah of considerable proportions, made in the Novy style of power and ripeness. It's suprising that Novy didn't priced it higher, as it has that extractive richness and inherent wealth of texture that are the domain of expensive red wines. Just tremendous in blackberries, chocolate and spices, with the most beautiful tannins. Drink now, with the finest meats., 94.0, 29.0
Italy, Riserva, Saturated and deep purple in color, this wine yields loads of toastiness, dry woodiness, soya and vanilla with a ripe undercurrent of blackberry and raspberry. Modern and built like a tank, it serves up velvety tannins and a spicy, long finish. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd., 94.0, 129.0
Spain, Blanco, Questionable value at $70, but this is very good and rather unique white Rioja. Remelluri uses a multitude of common and unheard-of grapes, and they hit it with a lot of oak. Still, amid the oily richness there's balance, acidity and excellent layering of grass, spice, apple, banana and lemon flavors. Big at 14.5%, but it will go really well with baked fish or lobster., 90.0, 71.0
US, , Soft, kind of flat and thin in flavor, with notes of apples, peaches and oak, and a dry finish., 82.0, 35.0
US, , Soft and rather vague in character, this average quality wine has modest cherry-berry, chocolate and sweet vanilla flavors. Drink now., 83.0, 27.0
Uruguay, , There's a disjointed layer of vanilla hovering over the fruit here, but the cherry cordial and raspberry flavors have an undeniable charm. In the mouth, there's fresh acidity and sinewy tannins followed by a final note of char. Drink sooner rather than later., 84.0, 19.0
US, Estate, Here's a powerful Cabernet Sauvignon, ripe and opulent, offering summer blackberry, sour cherry candy, currant, dried herb and rose petal aromas and flavors. The addition of 21% Merlot brings a candied softness, but it's still pretty tannic, and wants 4–5 years in the cellar., 92.0, 55.0
US, Fred, This estate-grown Syrah is racy, spicy and contoured, with well-polished structural facets. Raspberry, citrus and lavender scents abound, and the freshness on the palate marks this as a wine so delicious that it will be difficult to cellar. Drink it now or in five years—either way you'll be happy., 93.0, 47.0
US, Melodia, With fruit sourced from the excellent Hyland Vineyard, this blends a pair of Dijon clones and was aged in half new French oak for 15 months. Black cherry and cola syrup flavors combine in a sappy, concentrated midpalate. Highlights of underbrush and balsamic add flavor interest, and the dry, polished tannins frame the flavors perfectly. There's every reason to believe this can age well, but why wait?, 94.0, 39.0
France, , There is a tightness to this wine, initially softened by ripe fruit, then coming through in the form of dark tannins, a stony terroir-driven layer of dryness, firmness and a potentially powerful structure. There's no question, this needs to age—five years or more., 92.0, 155.0
US, , This is an okay wine, dry and silky, but it's just too cooked or stewed. Even out on the coast, the vintage was brutally hot, and you can taste how those grapes shriveled into raisins. There should be better results in '05 and '06., 84.0, 29.0
England, Blanc de Blancs, Sophisticated aromas of Golden Pearmain apples, cream and pastry take the part of the first violin—chalky, resonant earth that of the sonorous cello. Their harmony and elegance together is astonishing. The crisp acidity is so well-integrated and illuminates the fruit and soil. The long finish again emphasizes absolute, uncompromising elegance of this wine., 94.0, 49.0
France, Les Mazoyères, The density of a great grand cru from Gevrey-Chambertin is all here, magnified by the concentration of dark fruits and the firmest tannins. A powerful wine, it doesn't lose sight of ripe fruits, layered acidity and an edgy tannic structure on the finish., 94.0, 149.0
US, Terroir Coquerel, This is a thin, acidic wine, and it's not quite ripe, to judge from the green, grassy, ammonia notes. It's wonderfully dry and crisp in acidity, but that lack of richness makes it difficult to like., 83.0, 37.0
Australia, Orphan Bank, These 100-plus-year-old vines were transplanted to another site, but continue to yield outstanding wines. Intriguing aromas of fruit compote and roasted meat lead into a palate of blueberry and spice. It's medium to full in body, with supple tannins that finish on a faintly dusty note. Ready to drink now, but should hold at least through 2020., 93.0, 57.0
Italy, Cuvée Annamaria Clementi, A standout sparkler, this wine delivers an intense and complex bouquet ripe with peach, pineapple, toasted almond and egg custard. A brilliantly crystalline appearance underscores the acidity and crisp freshness on the palate. The wine's full, textured feel is most impressive. Imported by Paterno Wines International., 93.0, 157.0
US, F Block Rodney's Vineyard, Really not a very likeable Syrah despite some tasty cherry fruit flavors. The problem is enormously high alcohol, 15.9%, that makes the wine hot, and a near absence of acidity, which makes it cloying. The imbalance makes the tannins astringent., 82.0, 45.0
US, Cellar Select Blend, A full-bodied explosion of hearty ripe fruit is the story in this soft, straightforwardly approachable and enjoyable wine. It's blended with 15% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc and aged in oak, giving it smokiness and a length of spice that opens in the glass., 92.0, 65.0
Australia, Piggott Range, Like all of the Clarendon Hills wines, this is packed with intensity. It's full-bodied, with soft tannins and a slightly low-acid, natural feel. Aromas of menthol and roasted meat are backed by hints of blackberry and licorice on the palate and a long, lingering finish. Drink now–2020. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited., 92.0, 165.0
US, Late Harvest, Not a great success. It's sweet, but not enough to be satisfying given the flavors— citrus fruits edged with unripe vegetal., 84.0, 39.0
France, , A smooth, superripe wine, full of the sweetest fruit, big and rich. It is opulent, a powerhouse of dense Merlot fruits, rounded out with soft tannins., 92.0, 265.0
US, Hicks Family Vineyard, Shows the dramatic way that this mountainous region south of San Francisco can ripen Pinot Noir to such perfection. Brilliant in raspberry, cherry, sassafras, mocha, anise and cinnamon flavors, with rich notes of smoky cedar, it shows enough tannins to age it for a few years., 94.0, 59.0
Italy, , There's an odd note of jammy fruit and cherry tomato on the bouquet that is followed by disjointed notes of raspberry and pear. A touch of bitter almond appears on the close., 81.0, 53.0
Spain, Roda I, A sweet, ripe, jammy style for Roda I, with smooth tannins, corpulence and more than adequate minerality and power. This is not a flabby wine despite the heat of the vintage, and the lush cassis, blackberry and mocha notes come together on the back palate and finish., 91.0, 73.0
Portugal, Duas Quintas Reserva Especial, A concentrated wine, still just beginning its journey. The fruits are packed into a firm and tannic structure that shows edges of wood. Berry and plum fruits dominate this powerful but well-balanced wine. Keep for 3–4 years., 93.0, 67.0
Germany, Hattenheimer Wisselbrunnen Auslese, Delicate orange blossom and honey flavors meld with fresh, green herbal notes on this elegant, yet lushly textured, Riesling. The palate is off-dry with concentrated white peach flavors, but finishes dry on a lingering chalky note., 93.0, 167.0
US, Aria White Port, Not much going on in this Chardonnay-based Port-style wine. Its not particularly sweet, with basic white chocolate and pineapple cream flavors., 84.0, 49.0
Italy, Cerretta, Luigi Baudana enjoys a long history with the Cerretta cru and that experience has led to extraordinary results. This is one of the darkest Barolos we saw in 2004 and its thick concentration is offset by soft nuances of black cherry, vanilla, espresso and smoky overtones. It has thick, tart tasting tannins and offers loads of Indian spice on the finish., 94.0, 69.0
Italy, Riserva, This is an outstanding wine with a long list of adjectives to describe the bouquet: black olive, mesquite wood, black currant, anise, licorice, clove, dried sage and leather all play a role. There's intensity and complexity here and the wine offers smooth tannins backed by lingering notes of mineral and spice., 94.0, 169.0
US, Pommard Clone, Green and mint-like in scent, with a note that's reminiscent of grape stem, this Pinot Noir tastes hot from the high alcohol., 82.0, 55.0
US, Post Vineyard, Straddles an interesting line between drinkability and a wine that needs cellaring. This is lush with opulently ripe cherry and cassis fruit alongside tannins that, while fine, are strong. This distinguished wine should hit its stride in 2008, and hold for many years after., 92.0, 75.0
US, Gravelly Meadow, This baby Cabernet plays tricks on the palate, showing appealing soft, delicious complexity, then retreating into a cloak of tannins, and then emerging again with sweet fruit and spice. It's bone dry, although the cherries and blackberries show a baked-into-the-pie caramelized sweetness. Give this bottle a good six years in the cellar, and it should continue to evolve for far longer., 92.0, 175.0
US, Vecina, Polished, smooth and elegant. Made in a feminine style that appeals for its lushness and accessible flavors of blackberries, cocoa, violets and cedar. Shows a pure pedigree in the balance and charm. The tannins suggest mid-term aging. Best after 2012., 92.0, 275.0
Italy, Serego Alighieri Vaio Armaron, Vaio Armaron is a rich and opulent Amarone with oak-driven tones of spice, leather and tobacco that stand in pretty contrast against the wine's fresh berry fruit. The mouthfeel is dense, velvety and long., 93.0, 77.0
US, Estate, Soft and raisiny-Porty, with stewed blackberry and cherry flavors, this Syrah finishes dry, with a spicy cola taste. The wine is also quite tannic., 84.0, 59.0
Italy, Il Pareto, Made from a clonal selection of the estate's best Cabernet Sauvignon, this cheerful red is concentrated and extracted with a seductively sweet-smelling nose. It is by no means simple: Background aromas of tar, root beer, espresso, chopped mint and bright berry speak to its Tuscan roots. It's still a bit thick and chewy in the mouth, so drink it after 2012 and give it time to open., 94.0, 79.0
Spain, Malleolus de Sanchomartín, Graphite, maple and other oaky aromas dominate this lush, pitch-black Tinto Fino. A chewy, dense mouthfeel is rich as an oil baron, while oak-driven flavors of vanilla and baking spices accent blackberry and cassis. On the finish, this is monster-sized and full of blue-fruit deliciousness. Drink through 2020., 94.0, 179.0
US, La Jolla Del Norte Vineyard Block Two, This wine is sour, flat and past its prime, showing an abundance of tar and oak qualities., 82.0, 65.0
Italy, , Gaja's Barbaresco is a blend of 14 different vineyard sites, aged approximately 12 months in barriques and 12 months in larger oak casks. Shows plenty of spice on the nose—clove, cinnamon, anise—but also loads of cherry and red plum fruit. Sneakily tannic; it starts off silky, then the tannins build in intensity, coating the mouth. Drink 2010–2025., 92.0, 185.0
France, Les Charmes Premier Cru, Sumptuous and rich, a fully gorgeous Chardonnay, with butter and citrus flavors combining with panache. The wine just fill the mouth, a succession of pineapple, soft toast, spice and mango flavors, finished with acidity. To drink now, but it is worth keeping for 2–3 years., 94.0, 99.0
US, Mernet Reserve, There's a disconnect between Keenan's '02 Reserve Merlot, a gorgeous wine, and this 50-50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine has a cooked sweetness that, combined with softness, is rustic. It must have been the Cabernet. Stick with the Merlot., 84.0, 79.0
Spain, Liber Gran Reserva, Mature, ripe aromas of raisin, caramel, tobacco and fine oak form a pleasing, inviting bouquet. Drawing, edgy and still quite tannic in feel, this tastes rooty, baked and lightly stewed, with just enough berry and plum fruit to prop things up. On the finish, chocolate, prune and baked notes of pastry and cake are potent and delicious. Drink through 2027., 93.0, 97.0
France, , This is concentrated, but it's all structure at this stage. It has rich black fruits that lie under the dense tannins, with a potentially rich powerhouse of flavor. It needs at least six years of aging., 93.0, 197.0
US, Georges de Latour Private Reserve, It's young, dry, tight and tannic, although there's obviously a core of ripe black currant and cherry fruit. To evaluate this wine properly, you have to know its history as one of Napa's most ageable Cabernets. Still, it's not a great Georges. Hold until 2008 through 2010, but it could surprise., 92.0, 95.0
US, Destiny Vineyards Reserve, Soft and mushy in structure, with sweet, pie-filling flavors of berries that have a baked fruit edge, this Zin tastes like it was a victim of hot overripeness., 82.0, 75.0
Italy, , Thick, black and impenetrable, this is one of the most densely extracted wines you will ever encounter. Despite its extreme size, it maintains a fresh, delicate character throughout thanks to the obvious quality of the fruit. Opulent oak and spice tones might be distracting to Valpolicella purists—but make no mistake: this is an impressive and exciting wine., 92.0, 195.0
France, Les Tessons, Powerful wine, structured with apple skin tannins, layers of ripe, spicy toast and a taut, mineral character. There is something of the Meursault richness here, in the full white fruit flavors, but this is also a wine that needs to age., 91.0, 93.0
Italy, Oreno, Aromas of black plum, pipe tobacco, cooking spice and crushed herb lead the nose of this structured blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot. The smooth palate delivers dried black currants, blackberry extract, licorice and cloves wrapped up in velvety tannins., 93.0, 108.0
France, Cuvée Signature, This is an attractive, fast-maturing wine with soft tannins, ripe fruits and a juicy, perfumed acidity. It has considerable weight and concentration, along with firm red-plum and berry flavors. It's an elegant wine that should be drunk from 2017., 91.0, 193.0
US, Enigma, Opens with very attractive and complex aromas of white peach, apricot and smoke. The tremendous flavors show layers of fruit and spice that just roll off the palate. Still, this Rhone blend of Marsanne, Viognier, and Roussanne is quite dry, with terrific structure and intricate detail. Editors' Choice., 93.0, 18.0
Italy, Riserva, Shows a pretty, polished nose with dusty mineral notes backed by elegant tones of dried berry, spice and leather. Nice complexity and balance. Loads of tobacco-like sensations on the close., 93.0, 118.0
US, , As in past vintages, this is half DuBrul and half Meek vineyard fruit. It's a far cry from what most consumers would think of as Merlot—this is a stiff, tannic, muscular wine, with a deep earthiness that speaks of rich loam and ancient rock. It strikes me as more typical of Malbec. The tannins are firm and dense, and the fruits are black as coal and laced with tar and smoke., 93.0, 28.0
US, Fig Tree Vineyard, Made white Bordeaux-style, with barrel fermentation in partially new French oak and aged sur lies, this vineyard bottling is always interesting, but the '04 is one of the best. It's rich and creamy, with complex flavors of Meyer lemon, ripe fig, honeydew, crushed pineapple and peppery spice. Yet for all that, it's quite dry. Don't overchill, or you'll miss the nuances., 92.0, 16.0
France, Extra Cuvée de Réserve Blanc de Blancs Brut, A remarkable wine that manages effortlessly to bring together ripe apricot and sweet pear flavors with a balanced maturity that is so delicious. It has power and richness, but there is also minerality and a hint of a chalky texture. This 1999 needs less aging than previous vintages and can be drunk now., 93.0, 128.0
Chile, , With 19% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a deeply flavored, youthful wine, precocious and sharp with acidity, and fresh as newly crushed grapes. The dominant fruits are blackberries and plums, with a hint of bitter chocolate. The tannins are soft and creamy. It's a bit rough around the edges but is well made and gets the job done., 83.0, 8.0
Spain, Kripta Gran Reserva Brut Nature, Always one of Spain's best bubblies, this is precise and dry, with a dusty apple aroma and only a bit of yeast on the bouquet. It feels expansive and rich, with cutting acidity that's offset by yeasty cream, toast and butterscotch flavors. Juicy and generous at the same time., 92.0, 116.0
US, , Something went wrong with this Cab. There's a vegetal, herbal taste that distracts, with not enough richness to balance it out. The '03 also showed an green mintiness that lowered the score. Just seems wildly underripe, even in this hot vintage., 82.0, 95.0
France, , Half the 29 acres of the Domaine des Perdrix is in grand or premier cru, and this is a jewel in its range of wines. It has all the right density, rich black fruit flavors and edge of minerality, an impressively ripe wine from a lighter red wine year. The strawberry acidity gives extreme freshness at the same time as lifting the firm structure. For aging., 93.0, 228.0
Hungary, Betsek Aszú 6 Puttonyos, Heady with notes of orange marmalade and lavender, this honeyed Tokaji is remarkably brisk. Its showstopping acidity shines through the layers of caramel and orange cream. Effortlessly long on the palate, it is not at all cloying., 91.0, 104.0
France, , Slightly herbal on the nose, without the great intensity of some vintages, but still having pretty peppered raspberry aromas. This is a bit light in weight, but wonderfully supple, elegant and well-balanced. Finishes long, with silky tannins and a touch of cranberry. Drink now–2014., 90.0, 91.0
US, Eight Barrel, Profoundly rich, offering massive blackberry, currant, chocolate, bacon and spice flavors that are liberally oaked. A fine structure provides needed balance, with strong, finely ground tannins and brisk acidity cleansing the palate. Young now, and should develop for the next six years., 93.0, 38.0
Italy, Schidione, With eight years of age on it, this wine is at a beautiful point in its evolution with delicate elegance, refined perfumes and special accents on cinnamon, mineral tones and bright fruit. It's sophisticated and persistent, with silky tannins and sweet spice on the close., 93.0, 138.0
US, , Surprisingly, in the blind lineup, Ingleside's regular bottling of Merlot fared slightly better than its Reserve bottling of the same vintage. Overall, this is a supple wine, with flavors of chocolate-covered cherry and clove as well as a note of pear drop that cuts through the core., 83.0, 18.0
US, Highland, Morgan makes one of the best, most powerful Santa Lucia Chardonnays, and this less expensive bottling is a good approximation of their top tier. It's strong and potent, with cool-climate acidity framing mouthwatering pineapple jam, Key lime pie, kiwi fruit, white peach and vanilla cream flavors., 92.0, 26.0
Germany, Hochheimer Domdechaney Beerenauslese, Simply gorgeous aromas of honey, apricots and tangerines are echoed on the palate, where the wine is full, rich and sweet without seeming overly heavy. The moderate levels of acidity provide adequate balance now, but may prove too low for extended aging; that's okay, because it's so good now. Probably best over the next 5–10 years., 92.0, 126.0
Argentina, , Raw and lacking in concentration, this wine delivers pedestrian fruit with a lactic, buttery consistency. Finishes sweet but sort of gritty, and slightly medicinal., 82.0, 6.0
US, Resonance Vineyard, This biodynamically farmed vineyard delivers stunning, elegant, textured Pinot. Layer upon layer upon layer develops in the mouth, from the ripe strawberry/cherry fruit, masterfully speckled with toast, espresso and cola notes. The mouthfeel is silky and supple, and this lovely wine lives up to its name with an innate resonance that lingers gracefully in the mouth., 93.0, 48.0
Portugal, 40-year old tawny, A dark, concentrated wine, very impressive. But with all this concentration, there is also sweet fruit, flavors of apricots that have been bottled in spirits. This is a lovely wine, with just a hint of mature, medicinal character. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc., 93.0, 148.0
US, Grand Reserve, Soft, rustic and slightly sweet, with jammy flavors of cherries, blackberries, pepper and smoky oak. Drink now., 83.0, 28.0
France, Les Cailles Premier Cru, An already complete wine, the tannins well integrated into the firm black fruits and acidity. It is foursquare but also has a richness that comes from wood as well as lively final freshness., 91.0, 114.0
US, Crane Ranch Vineyard, This is quite a good Syrah from a small vineyard in the Oak Knoll area of the southern valley. Alcohol is very high (15.5%) but the wine wears it well due to the size of its fruit. Dried blackberries and pomegranates, sweet leather, violets and toasty new oak flavors comprise the flavors, and the finish is tannic and distinguished. This elegant wine is one to watch., 92.0, 36.0
US, , Harsh and raw, this 100% Cab has some decent cherry-berry flavors. But it's tough in tannins, with a rustic finish that's not likely to age out., 82.0, 16.0
Italy, Brunate, With fruit harvested from the beautiful Brunate cru located just a short distance away from the Barolo castle, this wine from Marcarini will delight you. The aromas here are full, generous and recall wild berry, cedar, smoke, licorice and cherry cola. Tight, firm tannins and bright acidity make the wine both cellar worthy and food friendly., 93.0, 58.0
Italy, Bongoverno, The super Tuscan category is infested with wines that just don't justify their price. A case in point: this vegetal, tannic red with murky fruit, coffee and heavy tannins. It's not particularly bad, just unblanced and underwhelming., 83.0, 38.0
Spain, Don PX Reserva Especial, This gorgeous dessert wine shows a coffee-colored tint that's backed by lush, deep aromas of fig, caramel, toffee and prune. The palate shows weight but a refined mouthfeel that's not sticky or heavy. Flavors of coffee, mocha, chocolate, caramel, peanut brittle and prune finish warm and long. Only 43 cases made., 93.0, 258.0
US, Sunchase Vineyard, A heady mixture of lemon custard and baked pear marks the entry to this full-bodied, deliciously decadent wine, from a high-elevation site above the Petaluma Gap. Honeyed aromas maintain themselves in the glass, accented in floral honeysuckle and ginger. Lovely and generous, it softens as it goes., 93.0, 68.0
US, 1772 Edna Ranch, Tolosa has been making seriously good Syrah for some years now. The quality shows not just in the ripeness, but in the acidity that gives the wine brightness and balance. This was a warm vintage, even in cool Edna Valley, and the wine shows extraordinarily powerful blackberry-pie filling, cherry compote and chocolate flavors, but that high acidity really makes the fruit sing., 92.0, 46.0
France, Clos de Vougeot, From a parcel at the top of the Clos de Vougeot slope, this wine shows fine concentration and rich tannins. It has a velvet allure that allows the sweet fruits to shine, but then reveals solid tannins. Black fruits, wood, spice and fresh acidity all sit well in the mix., 93.0, 168.0
Austria, , Evoking green grape, peach, honeysuckle and ripe melon, this Muscat's aromatic profile is as enticing as ever, all wrapped in a slender, absolutely dry and light-footed package. Full of rich flavor without the attendant weight, it embodies the scent and joy of summer and finishes on a refreshing note of zesty lemon., 91.0, 24.0
US, Family Estate Vineyard, Heavy and dull, with medicinal flavors like cherry cough medicine., 82.0, 26.0
Australia, Moritz, This wine is stylistically somewhere between the Liandra and the Brookman. It's rich and dense, packed with authoritative flavors of dark fruits—blueberries and plums—accented by espresso and smoke. Long and powerful on the finish, with 10-plus years of ageability., 93.0, 78.0
France, , You can feel the wood, rather than tasting it, such is the delicious fruit character: layers of ripe white fruits, shot through with citrus, white figs and crisp nectarine. The wine is edging towards youthful austerity but the fruit gives it great life and freshness. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports., 93.0, 178.0
US, Estate, I wanted to like this wine more, but it was hard, given the tough, minty green sharpness. Where's the ripe fruit, especially at this price? It's really not very interesting., 83.0, 58.0
Italy, Pressenda, The Barolo Pressenda opens with bold, black aromas of toasted hazelnut, crushed granite, prunes, plums and smoky barbecue sauce. That thick intensity follows through to the mouth where the wine shows concentration and a tight, dense style: Hold for five to ten years., 92.0, 56.0
France, Le Clarence de Haut-Brion, Firm and structured, this is a dark still-young wine. With a strong tannic core, it is concentrated, the black fruits are firmly in the throes of the tannins. Give this impressively serious second wine of Haut-Brion time. Drink from 2022., 92.0, 156.0
US, Grand Reserve, The winery has a mixed record with Cabernet and this release doesn't advance the cause. It's sharp in acids, with stalky, green notes, and the thinness of flavor accentuates the tannins, making them astringent., 82.0, 36.0
Italy, Riserva, This is a very pleasurable, smooth and rich Riserva that lavishes layers of chocolate fudge, vanilla bean and bright cherry. Overall, it shows good intensity and smooth consistency., 93.0, 88.0
US, Estate Grown, This is the first Monticello Syrah I've had, and it's a very impressive one. Grown in the cooler southern part of Napa Valley, it shows crisp acids and a peppery zest that make the blackberry, cherry and chocolate flavors extra enjoyable., 91.0, 34.0
US, Coopersmith, Tight and youthful, this wine unwinds slowly, in full command of its power and intensity. Compost, wild strawberry and a hit of citrus give life to the generous tannin and oak character, while savory black tea and cocoa flavors provide bite., 92.0, 66.0
Chile, Reserve, Overly sweet and candied, with creamy aromas of cherry-filled doughnuts, marshmallow and boiling jam. Somes across heavy and slightly medicinal on the palate, with lots of milk chocolate on the finish. Needs more balance and polish to rate better., 81.0, 14.0
Spain, Malleolus de Valderramiro, Undoubtedly powerful, but lovable. The nose is wholesome and complete, a blend of earth, coffee and heavy black cherry and plum aromas. Broad on the palate, with deep levels of dark fruit mixed with copious French oak. A big-time success in '02, and proof that good wines can come from marginal vintages., 92.0, 166.0
US, , Tough in tannins, austerely dry and thin in fruit, this Cab lacks voluptuousness. You'll find cooked cherry-berry flavors that are swamped by alcohol and tannins., 82.0, 46.0
Argentina, Bramare Marchiori Vineyard, Chunky black-fruit aromas are ripe but familiar, meaning the nose is pumped full of richness and oak. Racy acidity on the palate gives this modern Cab spine, while in the mouthfeel stays on the fast track due to zesty acidity. Flavors of cassis and blackberry register as fresh and ripe, and the finish is crisp and not the least bit flabby. Drink through 2016., 92.0, 76.0
US, La Serenne, An elegant and tart, cool-climate style of Syrah. Betz wines are always carefully structured and beautifully proportioned, and the winery has not over-reached in this somewhat difficult vintage. Extra hang time ripened the fruit while retaining good acids and flavors of boysenberry, sour cherry and raspberry. Hints of coffee and gravel add complexity. Best for relatively near-term enjoyment., 91.0, 44.0
US, Velvet Knees, This is way too soft and unstructured, especially at this price. It's a sweet, syrupy wine, with blackberry jam and cocoa flavors, and it's also high in alcohol., 82.0, 56.0
Spain, Hécula, A modern-style offering from the up-and-coming region of Yecla, near Alicante. The grape used is Monastrell, a k a Mourvèdre. It's bold and packed with blackberry, pepper and other spices. It's the perfect wine to enjoy with barbecue, stews and roasts. This wine busted onto the scene just a couple of years ago, earning accolades for its full flavors and overall character. For the price, it's a big-time bargain., 90.0, 12.0
US, Rosé of, Sought-after vineyard grower Charles Heintz has teamed with stellar Sonoma County winemaker Hugh Chappelle (Lynmar, Quivira) to make this divine estate-grown Rosé, pale pink in the glass with hugely inviting floral aromatics. From there is a bolt of electricity, the wine juicy and alive in peach, citrus and strawberry, mouthwatering and light., 93.0, 19.0
France, Morgeot Premier Cru, At this stage, this wine is closed and packed with acidity. But just wait for a few years and the ripe wood and yellow fruits will emerge. It's a full-bodied, rich wine that needs to round out. Drink from 2016., 90.0, 112.0
US, Homer, Homer is the estate reserve, and it's a complete, elegant and stylish wine, that is still in its infancy. Pretty baking spices wrap around tart cherry flavors. There's superb balance among components of fruit, herb, acid and tannin, and it's got excellent length, proportion and detail., 92.0, 86.0
France, Spiegel Grand Cru, Utterly glowing notes of pear already point towards richness. Notes of smoke and nuttiness prevent them from appearing facile. The palate rings with the same fruity glow and introduces soft, pliable sweetness. Earthy elements echo here and there from the concentrated, focused palate. This certainly leaves a mark and finishes almost dry., 93.0, 29.0
Austria, Dürrau, Made from a single vineyard, this is Franz Weninger's flagship wine. Pure Blaufränkisch, it shows all the exotic flavors of the grape—mineral, spices, black cherries—packaged with dark tannins and smoky, toasty wood. To finish, there is cocoa along with a touch of sweet citrus. Great aging potential., 93.0, 129.0
Bulgaria, Premium Quality Dry, Grassy with green leaf and fresh-cut herb notes, this dry, easy-drinking wine boasts lively lime-juice acidity and pleasant apple flavor. Slightly dusty notes of dried herb and reed distract on the finish., 83.0, 9.0
France, Les Baptaurels, An oak-aged cuvée, this wine nevertheless exhibits tremendous fruit. An aroma of brandied black cherry leads the way along with hints of cinnamon and menthol, picking up notes of vanilla and cedar on the palate. This big wine boasts a velvety texture and plenty of finesse, although the cedary note stands a little apart on the finish. Give it another 2–3 years of cellaring., 92.0, 96.0
US, Bonita's Hill Don Miguel Vineyard, Made from a block in the estate vineyard, the Chardonnay shows classic Green Valley acidity and savory flavors of Key lime pie, stony minerals, Asian pears and pineapple brûlée, with a rich coating of smoky oak. For all the opulence, it's totally dry on the finish. Complex and compelling. Drink now–2013 for freshness and vitality., 93.0, 39.0
France, GC, Intense wood-aged wine. The wood is still apparent in this intense, youthful wine, although the richly concentrated mint and black fruit flavors are sure to come through in a year or two. This is certainly ageworthy, a wine that packs all the right structure and dark fruit character., 93.0, 139.0
US, Carl's, Soft, simple and dull, with sugary raspberry and cherry flavors that quickly pall. It's hot, too, with incredibly high alcohol., 81.0, 34.0
Germany, Reitsteig, A meaty, mushroomy Pinot Noir, this rather expensive bottling from Franken offers decent complexity but lacks vibrancy., 82.0, 76.0
Italy, Rosa di Fonterenza, This organic, Sangiovese-based rosato opens with subtle tones of raspberry and citrus. The palate has a slender feel., 83.0, 19.0
US, Eastside Road Neighbors, Not quite as concentrated as the winery's single-vineyard bottlings, but nearly so, and showing the signature dryness, acidity and overall classy mouthfeel. Beautiful and complex, with raspberry, cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb, rose petal and cola flavors that arevarietally correct. Drink now–2014., 93.0, 49.0
Italy, Cannubi, Here's a boutique winery that has pushed forward over the generations to offer beautiful expressions of Nebbiolo. Of its three Barolos, we especially love this wine from the Cannubi cru: it embodies delicate harmony and lingering flavors of wild berries, mineral and spice. The wine is dry and firm on the palate and leaves a lasting impression of freshness., 93.0, 149.0
France, , A full-bodied, richly textured example of Hermitage, Belle's '04 starts off with scents of crushed stones, then adds flavors of melon and pear to the mix. It lingers elegantly on the finish. Drink now-2020., 92.0, 107.0
US, , This Bordeaux blend is juicy and inviting, with notes of tropical nuts and caramel over a base of plum fruit. The palate is crisp and berryish, winding down to a short vanilla finish. Drink up., 83.0, 29.0
France, , Corton-Charlemagne should have weight, and this wine has weight. It sits plumply in the glass, a big spice- and yellow fruit-flavored wine, layered with toast and ripeness. It is developing fast, but the lingering acidity does promise 4–5 years further progress. Imported by Palm Bay International., 91.0, 164.0
France, Pfersigberg Grand Cru, Christian Beyer is the 14th generation to run his family's estate. This wine is one of his jewels, a ripely luscious wine that's so well balanced. While honey creeps into the flavors, it's also full of fruits, with a ripe and unctuous texture. The spice gives a dry edge to the otherwise medium-sweet wine that's structured and firm at the end. Drink from 2017., 93.0, 59.0
Spain, La Nieta, This is a great wine, from a vintage that wasn't great. The nose is smooth and rich, with raspberry, plum, fine oak and all the spice that comes with it. The palate feels fresh and healthy, with racy blackberry fruit tempered by creamy chocolate, vanilla and spice. Like most high-end wines from the Eguren family, this is right on the money. Drink now through 2018., 93.0, 159.0
France, Echézeaux du Dessous, Jayer-Gilles has vines on the lower slopes of the Echézeaux vineyard, hence the subtitle of the wine, “du Dessous.” The wine has finesse, but with structure, and is impressively powered with tannins (although with a nagging green bean character as it opens up), spice, a definite amount of toast as well as freshly acid red fruits., 93.0, 259.0
US, Bien Nacido Vineyard, Much like Chardonnay, with a creamy texture framing ripe pineapples, mangoes, apple butter, toast and caramel. This is a big, powerful wine but one with great control and finesse., 90.0, 22.0
US, , Tastes thick, old and tired, losing cherry and raspberry fruit and leaving behind vegetal notes. Not going anywhere., 83.0, 39.0
Canada, Cave Spring Vineyard Estate Bottled VQA, Coming from vines ranging in age from 9–39 years, this is an aromatically complex wine, with notes of wet slate, orange peel and herb. It drinks off dry, with tart, mouthwatering acidity accenting the abundant stone fruit flavors—a thriller of a wine., 92.0, 17.0
Argentina, Reserva, Big and modern, this has simmering aromas of turned earth, graham cracker, leather, plum and blackberry. It feels megasaturated but well balanced, with hugely ripe black-fruit, chocolate and toasted marshmallow flavors. Warm and nearly Port-like, this is full of toffee and fudge notes on the finish. It's a flashy, polished, 21st-century red wine., 93.0, 69.0
France, , A round, full-bodied wine that goes for the generous, opulent fruity aspect of red Burgundy with its big, blowsy red fruits, just kept in check by tannins. The acidity is lively and fresh, keeping pace with the intense vibrant fruits. Screwcap., 93.0, 169.0
France, La Grande Dame Brut Rosé, This has a toasty edge that complements the ripe red fruit and attractive lemon and yeast character. It seems to be well on its way to maturity, retaining a fruity style while its flavors are beginning to dig deeper., 93.0, 269.0
Argentina, Finca Los Nobles, Brick in color and a bit Bordeaux-like in aromas, mouthfeel and flavors. Scents of dry herbs, tobacco and leafy red fruits are interesting and cool, while the palate mixes flavors of tobacco, dry fruit, brown sugar and herbs. Finishes with mild oak and coconut. Almost Rioja and/or Bordeaux in its overall presentation., 91.0, 74.0
Spain, Veraton, This full-bodied, ripe wine  offers blackberry and spiced plum aromas on top of a minerally base. In the mouth, it's big but fresh and free-flowing. Flavors of black plum and black cherry are lively despite some creamy oak that rises on the finish. Drink through 2016., 92.0, 27.0
Austria, Honivogl Smaragd, With its concentration and high alcohol, this wine almost overpowers in its richness. Lychees are the dominant fruit flavor, along with layers of sweetness and softness. At present, it still has to come together completely; drink 2013., 93.0, 79.0
France, , In this vintage, Echézeaux reveals an extra edge of really ripe, full fruits. They are balanced by the firm wood- and spice-laden structure, with the tannins and intense acids adding the final touches. Age this over 7–8 years., 93.0, 179.0
France, , Foursquare, almost chunky, the tannins dominate black fruits, dark chocolate and spice flavors. There is considerable concentration here, along with initial high acidity. Straight from bottling, the fruit is subdued. The weight of the wine, though, confirms that this is going to be a powerhouse., 93.0, 279.0
US, , Shows the creamy texture of Chardonnay, with the sweet-and-sour pineapple flavor of a Chinese food sauce., 82.0, 7.0
US, Reserve, Very fine Cab, young and tight in tannins now, but enormously promising. All the parts have yet to come together, but each part is really good. The flavors are ripe and delicious in cassis, blackberries, cherries, cedar, pencil lead and minerals. The tannins are thick and sweet. Acidity is as fine as Stags Leap gets, and the oak is lavish but tasteful. All it needs is time. Best 2008–2012., 93.0, 89.0
France, , Still young, this is a wine that needs to open and ripen. But already there are signs of richness, a wood- and tropical fruit-flavored wine that is typical of the full character of a Corton Charlemagne. It would be worth keeping 2–3 years for the wood to soften, the fruit to round out., 93.0, 189.0
Spain, , Never let the price tag dictate perceived quality; you may be disappointed. This tart, choppy, clumsily extracted Tempranillo is a case in point. Where's the balance and mouthfeel? This is why we blind-taste; save your $350., 81.0, 354.0
Italy, Ceppate, With 10% Merlot for extra smoothness, this Cabernet Sauvignon has amazing intensity with plum, blackberry, leather, spice bread, clove, chocolate and menthol notes that leap out of the glass. It's a beautifully harmonious wine with no aromatic element out of place and black fruit and spice flavors that are nicely rounded out by the oak. Soft, yielding and ready to drink now., 92.0, 37.0
France, Force One, On the oaky side, even for Colombo, but charged with superripe fruit as well, Force One makes a statement. Blackberries are slathered with chocolate and vanilla overtones, there's a rich, lush texture in the mouth, and the finish is long and mouthwatering. Drink now-2020., 92.0, 137.0
Austria, Steiner Hund Reserve, While there are signs of maturity, this wine still retains its original perfumed character, with aromas of spring flowers, and flavors of pear and cantaloupe., 91.0, 84.0
Argentina, Don David Reserve, Tropical fruit aromas are the lead-in, but upon airing the wine's pineapple and mango scents turn austere and prickly. The mouthfeel here is astringent and acidic, and the flavors are briny, even pickled., 82.0, 17.0
Australia, St. Henri, Because St. Henri is aged exclusively in large, mostly neutral oak vessels, it often requires more time to come around than Shiraz aged in barrel. The 2009 is tight and reticent on the nose, while showing hints of boysenberry, black olive and roasted meat on the palate. Full bodied, rich and firm in structure, with a long, amply textured finish, it needs a few years in the cellar, and should last at least through 2030., 93.0, 99.0
France, Belle Hélène, The 2004s at Ogier are tremendously successful, none more so than the family's top cuvée. The 2004 Belle Hélène boasts waves of creamy raspberry fruit framed by wonderfully supple tannins. Long-lasting on the finish, it's already delicious but should develop additional complexity through 2015., 93.0, 199.0
France, Le Pigeonnier, Le Pigeonnier, Lagézette's top wine, pushes Malbec to its limits. It's a big wine in all senses, perfumed, tannic with truffle and black fruits alongside a dense, extracted character. It will balance out as it ages, but will always be bold and powerful., 93.0, 299.0
Spain, Figuero Tinus, Toasty and black as midnight on the nose, this has mineral-driven, tight-grained oak, with a blackberry aroma that won't quit. It feels deep, dense and saturated on multiple levels, with black fruit flavors leading the charge, followed by clove and hickory accents. Warm, long and driving on the finish. Drink 2014–2020. Just over 100 cases and magnums made., 93.0, 599.0
US, La Encantada Vineyard, Lots of zesty acidity in this wine, which gives it a mouthwatering raciness. It's bone dry but ultrarich and ripe in cherries, raspberries and oak. There's a slightly bretty funkiness that adds a mushroomy appeal. Should develop over the next six years., 92.0, 47.0
Italy, Bricco Rocche, Already complex, this cru Barolo from Ceretto is packed with exotic aromas and flavors that range from pipe tobacco, cedar and cherries to tar, earth and mushrooms. A licorice or tarragon note pulls it all together. This is a full yet balanced wine that should age well for a couple of decades., 92.0, 147.0
Italy, Riserva, Unabashedly exhibits thick layers of roasted nut, espresso bean, black chocolate and spicy pipe tobacco. The wine is modern and plush and seems to be bursting at the seams in terms of richness and concentration., 90.0, 32.0
France, Premier Cru Perrières, Fresh toast and citrus aromas indicate a wine that is both full-bodied and balanced. The wood is very evident at this stage, giving a firm, toasty character. There are white peaches and citrus flavors, and long-lasting, refreshing acidity to finish., 90.0, 132.0
US, , Heavy, sweet and dull. Shows soft, sugary flavors of cherries and mocha, with thick tannins. Not likely to develop in the bottle., 82.0, 27.0
France, Terres de Noël Vieilles Vignes Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut, Milan is a specialist in Blanc de Blancs wines, and this is a top-quality example of that skill. It is as crisp as possible, very tight and bright. With a nervy, mineral character it speaks of the chalk soil of the vineyards. This is still young, very drinkable now while also ready to age for several more years., 91.0, 94.0
Germany, Wehlener Sonnenuhr Spätlese, Shows some characteristic Prüm stinky notes, but there's plenty of fruit lurking underneath. Pear, honey, melon and citrus flavors give an impression of great ripeness, amplified by the creamy texture and custardy mouthfeel, but there's also enough crisp acidity for balance. Drink now–2025, maybe longer., 92.0, 57.0
Australia, , Cream and blackberry fruit dominates this Cab's nose; on the palate, the cream explodes into a heavy oakiness that masks the ripe fruit, and even turns it a bit tart. Too much acid on the palate and on the back end. The finish is medium-long but tart., 82.0, 37.0
Italy, , Dried black cherry, pressed violet, tilled soil nutmeg and chopped herb aromas lead the nose on this big, bold red. The round, enveloping palate doles out dried plum, raspberry compote, licorice and black pepper alongside velvety tannins that lend it a polished feel., 92.0, 67.0
Hungary, Aszú Essencia, The sweetest Aszú wine, with 217 grams per liter of sugar (only pure Essencia is sweeter). Honeyed nuts, brown sugar, orange blossom and chocolate aromas waft from the glass. Full and viscous in the mouth, this balanced wine, with a modest 8.5% alcohol, has beautiful flavors of toffee, caramel and orange tea. Finishes long and complex. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd., 92.0, 167.0
Argentina, Reserve, Hot and horsey, and it remains forced and clumsy in the mouth. Tastes more sour than fruity, with a heavy, short, chunky finish. Drinkable only in an extreme situation., 80.0, 12.0
Italy, Riserva, Opens with dark, savory layers of Indian spice, candied fruit, plum, licorice and graham cracker. The texture is thick, viscous and rich, but a bright touch of acidity washes over the palate and keeps it refreshed. The endnote features tertiary aromas of leather, cola and crushed mineral., 91.0, 105.0
US, Pauli Ranch, This Barbera is soft, sweet and simple. It shows the rich tannins of the variety, but isn't ageworthy. Tastes like melted blackberry jam mixed with anise, black pepper and smoke., 82.0, 47.0
Italy, , Fuligni's newest Brunello is characterized by well-polished and very elegant tones of graphite and slate roof that give the wine a defined mineral backbone. It becomes more expansive on the palate thanks to its natural richness and fruit-forward berry flavors., 92.0, 77.0
US, Chamisal Vineyard Califa, This winery's regular '03 Syrah is a sensation. The Califa bottling is clearly a different wine, more tannic, deeper, darker and more brooding. It's also sweeter, although it's not clear if that comes from riper fruit or more new oak. Either way, this taster prefers the regular Syrah., 90.0, 42.0
Spain, , There's no denying the wine's power and intensity. It's concentrated like a cement block, with richness, plummy aromas, sweetness and char. But it's also candied and ultrarich in the mouth, with syrupy flavors of berry extract, cola and chocolate. A heavy wine that shows every ounce of its 15.5% alcohol. Ultimately it's more sweet and powerful than it is precise. Drink now through 2013., 90.0, 142.0
France, Côté Pierre Lys, This is a rich, complex Pinot Noir, with great ripe red fruits flavored with layers of acidity and wood. Produced by two Burgundian growers, Jean-Luc Terrier and Christian Collovray, it has a good resemblance to Burgundy in its finesse and complexity., 91.0, 15.0
France, Les Rugiens Premier Cru, Sweet new wood goes with rich plum skins in a wine that has a firm structure. The richness of the wine revolves around sweet cherries and juicy acidity. With the wood still dominant, it needs at least five years to settle down., 91.0, 115.0
Italy, Mantènghja, Dark and savory, this has masculine aromas of cured meat, leather and tobacco. It shows huge density and richness on the palate, with ripe prune, blackberry and currant notes. This Carignano would pair with barbecued pork., 92.0, 87.0
Italy, Riserva, With bold cherry, dusty earth and tobacco nearly blowing out of the glass, you get Brunello's aromas at their finest. Across the palate flows plum and offsetting pepper, while on the finish the wine gets tight as a drum courtesy of those patented fierce Brunello tannins. Very fruity but tight; drink 2005 or later., 92.0, 97.0
France, Sélection de Grains Nobles, Just a touch less lively than the 2002 and 2005 versions, Hugel's 2001 Gewürztraminer SGN is still excellent, boasting plenty of weight and richness allied to distinctive varietal aromas of rose petals and cracked white pepper alongside the dried apricot notes of botrytis., 92.0, 197.0
Australia, Wallace, This is mainly Shiraz, with only 20–25% Grenache, and it acts more like a Shiraz than a blend, offering up aromas of blueberries, tar and roasted meats. Hints of mint, vanilla and cedar complete the picture. Dense and thickly textured, it should drink well over the next 5–7 years., 91.0, 25.0
Spain, Celia, A bright and very pretty wine that bursts with raspberry and plum aromas. The palate is finely balanced and clean as a whistle, and in general this small-production bottling represents the region gracefully, but with some kick and power. It only gets richer and more serious with airing. Drink 2012–2022., 91.0, 125.0
Greece, White Dry Wine, Gold in color, with heavy aromas of corn oil, buttered root vegetables and chemical. A very strange bird that seems a touch oxidized. The edges are duller than a butter knife. Imported by Fantis Imports, Inc., 80.0, 22.0
France, Les Vaucrains Premier Cru, Rich and smoky, this is developing into a deliciously ripe wine. The tannins are already in balance with the plum juice flavors of the fruit, giving sweetness as well as power. Dark, intense, but very accessible., 92.0, 108.0
Italy, Tané, Big and ripe, this Nero d'Avola weaves together blue flower, leather, fleshy blackberry, black cherry, clove, sage, vanilla and subtle oak sensations. The juicy fruit is framed by round, velvety tannins. You'll also notice a warmth on the finish before it closes on a licorice note., 90.0, 52.0
France, Paris Brut, This is a full-flavored, round and spicy ready-to-go bottle of bubbly. The LeRoy Neiman graphics and cava-style bottle suggest party time, and the flavors are right up against banana-ish tropicality. But the ripeness is nicely cut with leesy acids, and the wine manages not to fall off a cliff; rather it extends itself with layers of stone and mineral., 91.0, 35.0
US, Connor Lee Vineyard, Single vineyard, pure varietal, with the focus and tight profile you might expect. Mineral flavors abound—chalk, graphite, and granite— which underscore the bright cranberry and currant fruit. This is a strikingly pure and well-defined Cab Franc., 92.0, 18.0
Italy, , Modern and smooth thanks to generous wood and toasted notes. Dusty cedar, lush vanilla with blueberry and mineral tones. Oak smoothness translates well in the mouth and is helped by mellow tannins. Any more oak would bring it over the top. Imported by Vias Imports., 91.0, 135.0
Italy, I Castagni, Made of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Syrah and 10% Teroldego, this boasts alluring ripe black currant and white pepper aromas, with a whiff of graphite. The firm palate offers juicy blackberry, black plum and tobacco notes, held together by polished tannins. Enjoy now–2025., 92.0, 118.0
Chile, Kai, Despite cool growing conditions in 2011, this version of Kai shows raisiny, fully ripe aromas of loamy blackberry combined with graphite. A rich palate is grounded by good acidity, while flavors of lemony oak, olive, mocha and vanilla work alongside core berry. On the finish, chocolaty notes blend with residual black-fruit flavors. Drink through 2018., 91.0, 235.0
US, , Dry, crisp and minerally, this Chard has intensely pure flavors of ripe white peach, pear, green apple and pineapple that have a stony scour of cold steel. It's the opposite of the modern style of oaky fruit bomb Chards, with an elegant integrity that's food-friendly and ageworthy. Fine now, and should do interesting things for a decade., 92.0, 28.0
Argentina, , A dynamite Malbec with heavy oak and the structure and foundation to match it. Lemon, hickory, leather, marzipan and black fruit aromas are powerful. In the mouth, tannins and extract create a vise grip to frame concentrated blackberry, coconut, pepper and lemon peel flavors. Layered and woody on the finish. Drink from 2012 through 2016., 92.0, 128.0
US, , Sharp and rough in the mouth, this features tobacco, green bell pepper and modest berry flavors., 81.0, 15.0
Italy, Il Picchio Riserva, Sophisticated and well-executed, with a dark, almost impenetrable consistency that has been enhanced by two years in oak barrique. Aromas of sweet vanilla and spice surround a core of juicy red cherry fruit. It has a thick structure, modern approach and long-lasting flavors of toasted nut and smoke., 91.0, 45.0
France, Charmes Premier Cru, With wood and white stone fruit in fine balance, this is a ripe, full wine, the acidity lighting up the ripe flavor. The wine has a broad character, ready for drinking in a year., 91.0, 145.0
Argentina, , Briny raspberry aromas are a bit murky. This smacks down hard with acidity, while the flavors run toward earthy, generic plum and berry. A salty finish with animal notes is firm but struggles with cleanliness., 82.0, 8.0
US, , Shows the full-bodied balance and texture of a fine Napa Cabernet, with rich, ripe tannins, although the flavors are all Petite Sirah. Wild forest black, blue and red berries, anise, pepper, leather, bacon and dark chocolate flood the mouth. Delicious now, and should evolve through 2014, with proper cellaring., 92.0, 38.0
Australia, The Freedom 1843, If not the oldest, the vineyard is home to some of the oldest Shiraz vines in the world (planted in 1843). Bright raspberry and cherry fruit is underscored by notes of smoke and mocha in this full-bodied Shiraz. The tannins are soft and turn dusty on the finish, making the wine approachable now, but it should still be going strong in 2025, and possibly beyond., 92.0, 138.0
US, Pony, Tastes like sugared mashed cherries, with heat from excessively high alcohol, namely 16.1%., 80.0, 32.0
Italy, Pinone Riserva, There's a raw, succulent element here that is reinforced by aromas of cherry and blackberry. This wine is distinguished by an intensely floral bouquet with notes of violets, lavender, incense and perfume. It's bright and tannic at this point, so give this wine a few more years of cellar aging., 90.0, 62.0
US, Zingy, Sweet and sour, with simple pineapple, mint and orange flavors, and a cut of tart acidity., 82.0, 18.0
US, Michael Black, Lots of zippy acidity perks up the cherry candy and butterscotch flavors of this Merlot, making it delicious. Despite the overt fruit, it has layers of minerals and dried herbs that lift its complexity. Drink now-2015., 91.0, 55.0
US, , Grown in the cool Coombsville area, this fruit-forward 100% Merlot has considerable charm. Dominated by rich flavors of cherry tart, blueberries, anise and butterscotch, it's a softly tannic wine to drink over the next few years., 92.0, 48.0
Chile, Kai, Mild, earthy and composed on the nose, this has rich berry and cassis aromas and not too much herbal essence. It feels voluminous and chewy, with medicinal black fruit, spice cake and nutmeg flavors, followed by a deep, almost-syrupy finish., 91.0, 155.0
US, Synnove, As sweet as a cherry and chocolate truffle, with peppermint sprinkles. Smooth and clean, but too sugary for a table wine., 82.0, 28.0
Portugal, Quinta dos Malvedos Vintage, A rich vintage of the ripe Malvedos style. It has great blackberry jam flavors, laced with just the right amount of tannins and an extra burst of ripe, sweet fruit. For medium-term aging., 92.0, 58.0
Portugal, Marias da Malhadinha, Named after family members called Maria, this is a limited-edition wine, very smooth and rich, offering its character slowly. It has complex acidity, smoky tannins and a hugely dense extracted texture. It needs aging over 5–6 years., 92.0, 158.0
Israel, Estate Bottled Reserve Kosher, Thin and light. Solid flavors of red cherry and berry jam lead into a short but lively finish. With virtually no tannins, this is a suitable choice for lighter chicken or fish dishes., 81.0, 35.0
Australia, Cellar No. One Reserve, Loaded with smoke, hickory and vanilla, this definitely shows plenty of oak, but there's also plenty of fruit to balance the ledger. Cola and blackberry flavors pick up a slightly tart edge on the long, finely textured finish., 91.0, 65.0
US, Winemakers Select Bin 11, The nose on this blend of Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon is a bit tight, with subtle notes of cocoa powder, raspberry and angel food cake. On the palate, fine tannins give structure, but the flavors taste equally muted., 82.0, 38.0
Italy, Vendemmia Tardiva, Late-harvest Vermentino makes for an interesting dessert wine that both sweet and fresh. Aromas include citrus, apricot, almond, dried herb and flower. There's a great deal of density and intensity packed in this precious bottle., 92.0, 68.0
Spain, Aquilon, Woody aromas of vanilla, blackberry, black plum and cassis are lactic and creamy. Concentrated and huge on the palate, but with enviable balance, this powerful, ripe Garnacha deals blackberry and dark-plum flavors prior to an oaky, spicy, chocolaty finish with peppery, blackened spice notes. This is a monster wine with 16.5% abv, but it can handle it., 92.0, 168.0
US, I, Rough and harsh in texture, this is a rustic, tannic blend of Tempranillo and Grenache that has overripe, burnt raisin flavors., 81.0, 45.0
US, Red Rock Terrace, Awfully good, a wine that strikes you right off the bat as important and complex. It's dry and densely packed in blackberry and cherry pie filling, red currant, licorice and sweet, smoky oak flavors. Very good and rich, with complicated tannins, and soft enough to drink now, although it should age well., 91.0, 175.0
US, Pluribus, Very polished and pure, if a bit direct and obvious in appeal. A beautiful wine, with pure flavors of currants and cedar. Drinkable now, and should hold through the decade., 91.0, 275.0
Italy, Muffato della Sala, You can smell those distinctive notes from the muffa nobile, or botrytis, that has shaped a deep and layered wine with notes of peach fuzz, candied fruit, apricot and white almond. The wine is sweet, but not exaggeratedly so, and has a bright, elegant mouthfeel., 91.0, 375.0
Germany, Abtsberg Auslese 70, Full-bodied and viscous without being overly sweet, this intense, powerful expression of Riesling features hints of apricot, bold green apple and lime notes and a touch of mushroom. The finish boasts heaps of spice and crisp acids for balance, trailing away ever so slowly., 92.0, 88.0
US, , Smells funky. Although it's richer in the mouth, with blackberry, currant and cedar flavors, it's hard to get beyond that not-quite-clean smell. Something's tamping down the fruit, leaving behind alcohol and oak., 82.0, 58.0
France, La Louvée, This is cool and restrained, with peppery flourishes layered over raspberry fruit. Rather than being massive or intense, it's medium bodied, perfumed and elegant, with hints of dusty tannins that build slowly on the finish. It's approachable now, but should age well through at least 2023., 91.0, 85.0
Chile, Lagrimas de Luna, Overoaked and hot, with sour raspberry fruit. Plain and simple, this wine has way too much wood, tannin and fire to it. And the price is outlandish., 81.0, 55.0
Italy, Preda, Preda is a solid and dense expression of Barolo with oak-related notes of vanilla and spice that need a few more years to integrate fully. The quality of the fruit is evident and with 10 more years of cellar aging all those elegant Nebbiolo aromas of licorice and white truffle should shine through., 92.0, 98.0
US, Special Reserve, Smells distinctly Porty, with a baked fruit, caramelized aroma, but is surprisingly thin and tannic in flavor. Just barely suggests blackberries cooked into a pie., 82.0, 68.0
Italy, Solare Vino di Tavola, Seductively layered on the bouquet, where dried fruits, leather and earth create an Old World welcome party. Plenty of solid red-fruit flavors carry the palate of this Sangiovese/Malvasia Nera blend, and there are background notes of coffee, pepper and chocolate that add complexity. Will go great with meat or pasta., 91.0, 95.0
US, Cask 23, A very good but not great Cask 23, showing plenty of decadence and flair but not perhaps that extra edge of complexity. It's forward now in sweet new oak and flashy, jammy blackberries, cherries and raspberries. The tannins are quite an achievement, rich, vibrant and supple. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's full-bodied and dense, with a chocolaty finish. Could gain in the bottle beyond 2012 to about 2018., 91.0, 195.0
US, Reserve, Feels hot and Porty in the mouth, although it's very dry, with bitter raisinskin and shriveled cherry flavors. The alcohol approaches 16%., 81.0, 65.0
France, Vieilles Vignes, This all-Roussanne cuvée is a broad, fat wine that somehow pulls itself together to deliver a long, mineral- and spice-tinged finish. Some nice pineapple fruit holds it together through the midpalate. Has a reputation for aging well, so this score may seem conservative in five years' time., 90.0, 182.0
US, , Keuka Spring Vineyards staged a remarkable renewal recently by introducing August Deimel, increasingly one of the Finger Lakes most promising young winemakers, as its head winemaker. This delightfully brisk Cabernet Franc showcases the crispness of sweet-tart black plums and cherries swathed in a finery of fresh, green herbs. It's deeply concentrated with black fruit flavors, yet elegant and refined, finishing long on a flurry of feathery tannins., 92.0, 19.0
France, , While it still has firm tannins, the wine is now also showing maturity. The color is changing, the hints of berry fruits fading behind the sweet and sour flavors and the dark, dry core. The wine has considerable acidity, leaving an aftertaste that is still fresh., 92.0, 119.0
Italy, Le Coste, This expression of Nebbiolo from the Le Coste vineyard opens with fresh and vibrant aromas of cherries, raspberries and cassis. Those fruit notes are enhanced by spice, vanilla and smoky highlights that brighten up the wine's firm but streamlined mouthfeel., 91.0, 106.0
South Africa, TMV White, Curvy, full and luscious but underpinned with a fresh acidity that gives the wine balance, this white blend from Tulbagh Mountain has a creamy fruit and spice character that is both delicious and unique. The wine finishes with length but is clean. Could handle richer dishes but is still delicate enough to augment lighter fare., 92.0, 29.0
France, La Landonne, Possessed of a powerful charred, espresso-like character on the nose,   this isn't that fruit expressive at first, but on the palate black olive and black cherry flavors surge forward, framed by layered tannins and showing great persistence. Needs time; try from 2012., 92.0, 129.0
France, , Flowery and smoky aromas introduce a perfumed, ripe wine. Gentle at first, the tannins gradually show through, part of a solid texture that gives density. Fruit goes from damsons through black cherries and a layer of wild strawberry. For long-term aging., 92.0, 229.0
Italy, Vigna S. Caterina, Elegant and pure in essence, this traditional interpretation of Barolo offers a long and steady aromatic lineup of wild berry, spice, cola and mineral aromas. The wine feels streamlined and pristine in the mouth and will age many more years in the cellar., 92.0, 39.0
US, Syrca Red, A reversal from past Syrcas, this flips the blend to 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Syrah. It remains a sensational value, introduced with a beguiling nose of toast, smoke and coffee grounds. The tart, tangy red-fruit flavor has length and style; the wine seems sculpted., 91.0, 16.0
Portugal, , A sugar water style of Vinho Verde, all sweetness and acidity. It is fresh and clean, very crisp and green., 82.0, 9.0
France, Joyau de France Brut, The millennium year, 2000, was not the greatest Champagne vintage. However, Boizel has released a prestige cuvée from that year and produced a well matured wine with a dry character and plenty of toasty notes. Dominated by Pinot Noir, it is deliciously rich and totally ready to drink., 91.0, 116.0
Chile, Don Maximiano Founder's Reserve, Deep and dense wine, with beet, floral and black fruit aromas. The palate offers good acidity, balance, richness and complexity, while the flavor profile of raspberry, plum and dry herbs is attractive. Finishes mildly toasty, with a hint of herbs and tomato. Best from 2011–14., 90.0, 92.0
France, La Chapelle de la Mission Haut-Brion, This is a finely perfumed wine with its dark tannins and juicy black-currant fruit. It has structure and a dense texture although this is filled with the bright acidity that gives the wine a lift. This will age well, so drink from 2021., 92.0, 49.0
France, Les Suchots Premier Cru, Fine ripe fruit here, with soft, sweet berries and surprisingly smooth tannins. The wine is rich, not heavyweight, but glorying in the opulence of Pinot Noir. The finish brings on the tannins again., 92.0, 149.0
France, Cuvée Héritiers Latour, There is plenty of the proper power and intensity of a Chambertin here, resulting in a structured wine. It is dense, packed with black plum flavors, with a hard edge of spice and tannin. Obviously, there is a long-term future here, and it should not be touched for 5–6 years., 92.0, 249.0
US, , A common or garden variety Chardonnay whose flamboyant caramelized oak flavors dominate the pineapples and limes., 82.0, 19.0
France, Fleur de Champagne Rosé Brut, All raspberries and red currants, this is a delicious, instantly approachable wine. It also has a more complex side, intense acidity, a tight texture followed by a juicy fruit character. It is a wine for celebration as well as more serious appreciation., 92.0, 349.0
US, Cold Creek Vineyard, This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years., 91.0, 26.0
Spain, Zemis, A high-water mark for Jean León, which usually sticks to varietal wines. Zemis, on the other hand, is a blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Cab Franc that makes its point. After a tight, bruising, sulfuric beginning, the wine finds its groove, showing black cherry, plum and earth flavors. Thorough and rewarding; a fine red from Penedès., 91.0, 126.0
Italy, Barabba, Here's a standout Barbera from Monferrato with loads of intensity, complexity and persistency. You'll get aromas of blackberry and cherry followed by exotic spice, vanilla and pipe tobacco. The mouthfeel is smooth, soft and thick. Excellent., 92.0, 59.0
US, Rouge, Somewhat underripe, this Bordeaux-style blend has modest cherry and boiled asparagus flavors., 81.0, 95.0
US, Blanc du Rhône, This is way too sweet, with too sweet flavors of pie-filling peaches, pineapples and apricots. More like a dessert wine than a table wine., 82.0, 29.0
Italy, Nocio dei Boscarelli, Tight and pure, with mineral and charred oak dominating the pulsating nose. From a great vintage, this is like a baby just out of diapers. Now it's oaky, but there's also a boatload of raspberry, cherry and plum waiting to take over. Best to cellar until 2008 so that the fruit and wood will be perfectly integrated. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd., 92.0, 69.0
US, Las Madres Vineyard, Concentrated and savory, this brooding wine is supple in tannins and layered in black olive and leather. It hangs together well, measured acidity dancing on the palate from first sip to last, accessorized by juicy red fruit, anise and toasty tropical oak., 91.0, 36.0
US, Special Selection, This young wine is fairly tough now, and the fruit is hiding behind the oak and tannins. Like many keepers, it's in a trough, and will go through its ups and downs. Eventually, the cherries and blackberries should emerge, but it doesn't seem like one of the great Special Selections., 91.0, 136.0
US, Mare Nectaris, Gritty and raisiny, with astringent tannins and a bitter, shriveled grapeskin finish. A chunky, rustic wine that's at its best now., 82.0, 39.0
Spain, Opera Prima, Lacquer and apple cider aromas lead to a sticky, sweet palate. There's a citric edge to it but mostly it's just sweet and tastes like orange slices and jelly beans. Imported by CIV/USA., 81.0, 6.0
Italy, Cannubi, This offers aromas of toast, espresso, scorched earth, red berry, clove and a whiff of leather. The lean, tense palate offers dried cherry, grilled herb, anise, coffee and tobacco but not much fruit richness. Tightly wound, bracing tannins and nervous acidity provide the framework., 90.0, 103.0
Italy, Cerequio, Aromas of perfumed berry, scorched earth, rose and cake spices lead the nose. The structured palate offers wild cherry, crushed strawberry, white pepper, clove and aromatic herbs alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and lively acidity. It's almost accessible but will be even better in a year or two. Drink after 2018., 92.0, 79.0
US, , Summers has been quietly perfecting Cabernet under the radar. The '04 continues a string of successful vintages. It's riper and more accessible than previous years, and rewards for expressive black currant flavors enhanced with lots of fine, smoky new oak. The tannins are so gentle, you can drink this wine now, but it should hold for a good six years., 91.0, 46.0
Argentina, Cosecha de Otoño, Heavy, with aromas of cornflakes and peach syrup. Unctuous and chunky as can be, with sweetness dialed up to the max. Finishes like a bull in a China shop, with canned pear, honey and raw sugar., 80.0, 72.0
Austria, Ried Holzspur Grande Reserve, This could be the apotheosis of St Laurent, a powerful statement of great concentrated tannins and texture to go with the naturally red fruited character of the grape. Spice and cherry meld with mint from the wood and the wine ends with delicious fresh and pepper juiciness. For aging 2–3 years., 92.0, 89.0
France, Rosé Excellence Brut, Soft, sweet and full-bodied, this sparkler is a Christmas party number, its freshness masked by strawberry and sugar flavors. The aftertaste is verging on bitter., 81.0, 16.0
France, Les Archevêques, Despite showing a relatively dark straw hue, this wine is fresh and floral on the nose. The full-bodied palate is lushly textured, showing amply concentrated melon and apricot fruit and a dusting of white pepper. Drink it over the next year or two., 92.0, 99.0
France, , The wine is defined by its power and dense concentration. It shows solid black fruits, plums, fig and licorice as well as dark tannins. It seems a little austere at this young stage and needs several years to flesh out., 92.0, 299.0
US, Clos Pepe Vineyard Early Harvest, Adam Tolmach picked the grapes a little earlier than usual for this low-production bottling. It's definitely not as ripe as his other Pinots, showing an aroma of grass, dried hay, nettles and sage. Yet the wine turns richly complex in the mouth, offering waves of cherries, raspberries and spices. Should age well and interestingly., 91.0, 56.0
US, , A fascinating wine. Tastes sweet and finishes bone dry, offering rich, tangerine and honey flavors, accented with crisp acidity. Nice as a cocktail sipper, and will play well with Asian fare., 90.0, 13.0
Italy, La Serra, The La Serra cru lies right above Cerequio and offers a glorious panoramic view of the town of Barolo. Poderi Marcarini has a long association with this vineyard and has carefully harnessed the natural aromatic intensity of the fruit grown here. Blackberry, cassis and raspberry are enhanced by spice and vanilla. It's a tight, firm wine. Drink after 2018., 91.0, 66.0
US, Hillside Estate, Awkwardly tannic and medicinal, this has tough flavors of blackberry and cherry cough lozenge., 81.0, 36.0
Argentina, Bramare Rebon Vineyard, Smoky, roasted aromas of black fruits, bacon and herbs are the kickoff. The mouthfeel is plump and full but offers vital acidity at its core. Flavors of black plum, hoisin sauce and savory spices finish smoky and ripe, with a lasting note of bacon. Drink through 2018., 91.0, 76.0
US, , This elegant Cabernet Franc is drinking beautifully, just beginning to round out the hardness of youth. The wine has a firm and confident backbone, which seems to wrap the acids and tannins tightly together. The framework supports the crisp, clean, immaculately ripe fruit, with flavors of plum, cherry and red licorice. Just 25% new oak was used, adding a light toasty touch to the finish., 90.0, 23.0
France, Rotenberg Wintzenheim Vendange Tardive, It may not be a Séléction des Grains Nobles, but this still has the intoxicating orange zest and honey aromas. Similiar notes echo on the palate; will need many years to develop., 90.0, 123.0
Argentina, Brote Negro, Here's a full-of-dynamite, small-batch Malbec that smells of bold berry fruit mixed with earth, smoked meats and mocha. The flavor set is pure, driving blackberry with mild herbal accents, and the finish is long, flavorful and lightly herbal. Expensive and a little fiery, but still excellent. Drink now through 2013. Only 250 cases made., 91.0, 86.0
Spain, Neo Punta Esencia, Inky dark, with coconut, baking spice and leather on the otherwise fruity nose. There's a lumber yard's worth of oak here, but overall it works. The spice element is undeniable, while the quality of the fruit supercedes any raw wood quality. A bit simple and forward, but nothing to take issue with., 91.0, 96.0
France, Les Champgains Premier Cru, Still closed up, this is potentially a ripe and delicious wine. As it develops, apple, citrus and apricot fruits will come out, backed up by the steely, mineral texture. The wine is already juicy, concentrated and shows a toasty side as well as rich fruitiness. Drink from 2017., 91.0, 196.0
Portugal, Casa Velha Colheita Seleccionada, A strongly wood aged wine, powered by tannins and dense fruits, it is concentrated and still young enough for the wood to show through although the fruit is developing well. This is a structured wine that will need plenty of time to age so drink from 2018., 90.0, 33.0
Germany, Erbacher Steinmorgen Auslese, A big, sturdy auslese, nearly dry in style yet showing some botrytis and plenty of concentration. Hints of dried apricots and mushrooms lead the way, and there is some citrusy character, but this brooding wine is best served with cheeses or savory dishes., 91.0, 107.0
Germany, Casteller Reitsteig Trocken, Slightly feral, with baked fruit notes alongside hints of coffee grounds. Disappointing; lacks freshness., 81.0, 76.0
Australia, Show Reserve, A pleasant surprise, this Show Reserve offering combines toasty, mentholly oak with blackberry and blueberry fruit, all supported by plenty of weight and firm tannins. Vanilla and cedar on the finish is balanced by dusty, briary fruit., 91.0, 17.0
Austria, Ried Oberer Wald, Red plums and black cherries dominate this ripe, fruity wine, which brings in plenty of fresh acidity to balance the dry underlying tannins. The Oberer Wald vineyard, on the eastern shores of the Neusiedlersee, gives uncomplicated wines that are great partners with hearty food., 90.0, 43.0
New Zealand, Pioneer Block 4 Sawcut, The best of this year's crop of Saint Clair Pinots is the Pioneer Block 4, which boasts dark and mysterious aromas of damp earth and ripe plums. It's full bodied and creamy in texture, with hints of mocha emerging on the supple finish. Drink now–2015., 91.0, 27.0
Germany, Hochheimer Domdechaney Trockenbeerenauslese, Similar in aromatics and flavor to Werner's slightly less weighty BA, the TBA features musky scents reminiscent of tropical flowers as well as tremendous weight and texture. Molasses and caramel notes reverberate on the long finish., 91.0, 227.0
Italy, L'Arringatore, L'Arringatore is a 60-30-10 blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Ciliegiolo that boasts a clean modern approach and expert fruit extraction. The nose is sweet-smelling with cherry, almond, blueberry, chocolate and spice and the wine offers a pleasantly approachable intensity of aromas. It's big and brooding in the mouth with plush tannins and noticeable oak-driven flavors on its beautiful, long-lasting finish., 91.0, 37.0
Italy, Il Bricco, A rich, velvety wine that falls firmly into the modern camp without losing its regional or varietal identity. The 1999 Il Bricco boasts aromas of toast and vanilla layered against a backdrop of ripe cherries and plums, adding in notes of cinnamon and clove. It's rich and velvety in the mouth, with substantial, supple tannins on the long finish., 91.0, 137.0
US, , Just barely drinkable, with sweet and sour raspberry fruit sauce flavors., 80.0, 13.0
Australia, Steeple Jack, While this wine isn't lacking concentration, its aromas are of stewed and overcooked fruit and it turns a bit sharp on the finish. No improvement with age., 81.0, 7.0
Portugal, Baron Gustav von Fürstenberg, The wine is powerful and concentrated but also beautifully elegant, its richness balanced with acidity, damsons and a layer of dark chocolate. Age this fine wine for 3–4 years., 91.0, 47.0
France, Les Damodes Premier Cru, A strongly tannic wine, founded on red plum skin and cranberry fruits, with a solid, chunky character. It needs to soften, but it will always be a wine on the dry, tannic side., 90.0, 153.0
Chile, Tribute, Heavy aromas of horse stable and compost give this wine a classic “barnyard” nose, and while it does settle somewhat it always maintains its bramble and tomato flavor profile. This is herbal, rough Shiraz and no matter the size or oak it's a tough trek., 81.0, 17.0
Australia, The Merle Reserve, Pikes' reserve-level Riesling is one to seek out. It has hints of fresh green herb interspersed with layers and layers of stony, minerally flavors. The wine is intense and has lively acidity and a long, smooth finish. 180 cases produced. Imported by USA Wine West., 91.0, 57.0
Italy, , Well oaked and woodsy, with some earthy nuances as well as scents of campfire and rubber. This is a youngster with aggressive tannins and sharp edges. With a bit of time it'll soften, leaving a top-flight wine with cherry, citrus rind and a hint of sweet oak., 90.0, 63.0
Italy, Salvioni, A full-bodied wine with cured meat, barbecue, black fruit, toasted almond, leather and tobacco aromas. It feels smooth and opulent, with good structure and a velvety texture., 91.0, 167.0
Italy, Riserva della Famiglia, This beautiful Riserva della Famiglia offers immense sophistication and density with loads of spice, dark fruit and oak-related aromas. It is unlike any other Barbera you will taste thanks to the depth of its complexity and its overall intensity., 90.0, 163.0
Hungary, Szt. Tamás Aszú 6 Puttonyos, From a southwest slope facing the village of Mád, this sweet Tokaji is earthier then the Nyulászó, but also has scents of brown sugar, clove and dried figs. Medium-bodied and complex in the mouth, with citrus, earth and honey flavors, the acidity gives good backing and a citric finish. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd., 91.0, 77.0
US, Rhondezvous, There's a vegetal underripeness to this Grenache-based blend. The asparagus flavor is matched to the sweet cherry and pickle relish notes, accented by sour acidity., 81.0, 37.0
France, Clos du Mesnil, A wine that has created its own universe. It has a unique, special softness that allies with the total purity that comes from a small, enclosed single vineyard. The fruit is almost irrelevant here, because it comes as part of a much deeper complexity. This is a great wine, at the summit of Champagne, a sublime, unforgettable experience., 100.0, 1400.0
France, Clos du Prieuré Monopole, Intensely ripe fruit gives this wine a rounded, mouthfilling character, packed with sweetness, dense black jam and rich tannins. Through it all comes a fresh acidity to sharpen the palate. The finish brings back some tannins and structure., 91.0, 87.0
France, L'Ancestrale, An old-vine wine, this is powerful, concentrated and impressively dense for a Marsannay. It is full of red plum and berry flavors, plus firm tannins that suggest this could age for several years., 90.0, 73.0
US, Schultze Family Vineyard, Unattractive, with funky, medicinal cherry flavors and a soft, collapsed texture. The oak sticks way out., 80.0, 33.0
US, Bacchus Vineyard, Pungent aromas of concentrated stone fruits, bubble gum, a whiff of diesel and pine tar introduce a multidimensional wine with lip-smacking acidity. All stainless fermented, no malolactic, no acidification—just a clean, pure, natural and richly delicious wine, loaded with ripe, luscious peach, pear, papaya and apricot fruit., 91.0, 8.0
Mexico, , Ripe and rich, but not dull or out of whack, this smells sweet, a little soupy and densely fruity, with a cumin accent. It feels concentrated and full bodied, with black fruit flavors of roasted plum and blackberry. It's mellow, dealing brown sugar on the finish. This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo; drink now–2013., 91.0, 108.0
Italy, Maria di Brun, Once past some funky burnt-matchstick scents, this wine really shines, mixing cherry, leather and dried spices together in a richly textured, creamy wine that finishes with masses of soft tannins. Should be approachable by 2008, and mature gracefully until 2016 or beyond., 90.0, 83.0
Austria, Purbach Sublime, This wine leads with a touch of smoke and cinnamon. The underlying blueberry fruit is brooding and crunchy, bringing freshness to the medium-bodied palate. Aromatic waves of spice and pure, vibrant fruit carry long into the finish., 91.0, 18.0
France, Beaune Grèves Premier Cru Vigne de l'Enfant Jésus, One of Bouchard's signature wines, this is beautifully textured, a series of bright fruits, strawberries and sweet acidity. There are tannins, but this is lighter than in some vintages, a wine for short-term aging., 91.0, 118.0
Germany, Kiedrich Gräfenberg Beerenauslese, Fragrant, with notes of orange blossom, honey and wax, this delicate beerenauslese balances intensely sweet flavors of marmalade and peach nectar with savory tones of herb and earth. It's sprightly and bright on the palate, with a long honey-kissed finish., 91.0, 318.0
US, , An unabashed California Chardonnay with buttery aromas, sunny fruit flavors of ripe pear and peach, and a lingering finish that hints at vanilla and cream. Fresh acidity and a light touch of oak keep the texture lively and refresh the palate. FEL is a cool-climate line of wines from Napa's Lede Family Wines., 91.0, 28.0
Italy, Bernardot, Pretty aromas suggest violet, sandalwood, incense, plum and chocolate. The ripe palate offers crushed black cherry, mocha, espresso and vanilla alongside firm tannins. A licorice note signals the close., 90.0, 93.0
France, Clos Liebenberg, A really taut wine, this is very nervy. It brings out the ageworthy qualities of fine Alsace Riesling, offering white fruits and fragrant acidity. Crisp and fruity on the surface, it is steely right at its core. Keep for 3–5 years., 91.0, 38.0
Spain, El Bosque, Hard and tannic to start with, so it really needs time. Aromas of beef bullion, jerky and soy convey a certain smokiness, which is more geared to the nose than the palate. As for taste, it's laced with black cherry, cinnamon, vanilla and chocolate. Very tight and firm, so hold for another three years., 91.0, 138.0
US, Keefer Ranch, Right out of the bottle, this wine is tannic and closed. After a while in the glass, it starts to soften, showing mushroom, cola, pomegranate and raspberry flavors, but it's still resistant. Give it until 2018, and it should gradually unfold for another few years afterward., 91.0, 48.0
Argentina, , Vaguely floral aromas precede a sweet, cloying palate that tastes candied., 81.0, 8.0
US, Reserve Unfined, Unfiltered, A very ripe tropical-fruit nose is complemented beautifully by an intense smoky-toasty element. Pineapple, mango and caramel flavors stand out on the full palate: The smoky note resurfaces later, riding out the persistent finish. This is a sleek, stylish, but very solidly built Chardonnay. It pushes all the right sensory buttons, with big body and great lines, like a '56 Buick., 91.0, 58.0
Spain, Becquer, Almond candy and lacquer aromas create a corny scent on the nose. This wine feels flabby and soggy, with buttery oak and little to no fruit flavor. Finishes woody, with vanilla and spice. A blend of 60% Viura and 40% Chardonnay., 81.0, 18.0
US, OGV Estate, The Olivet Grange vineyard is in the foggy southern part of the valley, where Pinot Noir is seldom opulent in youth. With this cool 2010 vintage, the wine is tightly wound with acidity and tannins masking inherent cherry, cranberry, rhubarb and pomegranate flavors. The official alcohol is a remarkably low 12.5% abv. It's a very fine wine, but you want to give it 5–6 years to come around, 91.0, 68.0
France, , This is packed with just the right amount of tannins and dark fruits. It has weight, structure and a blackberry note. It needs to age at least five years for the full character to emerge., 90.0, 14.0
Germany, Erdener Prälat Auslese Gold Capsule, Sprightly and crisp, with just 7% alcohol, this dainty Riesling is juicy and brisk, with loads of sweet-tart tangerine flavor. Layers of bitter citrus rind and lanolin, along with a steely midpalate, add depth, extending to a long, lemony finish., 90.0, 114.0
Italy, Gran Cuvée Rosé, This feminine, delicate rosé sparkling wine from northern Italy opens with a beautiful peachy-pink color and lively aromas of stone fruit, cranberry, pink rose, dried grass and crushed mineral. Pair this wine with caviar or smoked salmon., 91.0, 78.0
Spain, Ad Libitum, Smells briney and pickled, much like sauerkraut. The palate has an angular feel, choppy acidity and pickled flavors of apples and wheat. Briney to the max; not very appealing year after year., 81.0, 38.0
Italy, Brut Millesimato, A strong show from one of Italy's most regarded sparkling producers. Offers rich aromas of baked apple, Graham crackers and buttered biscuits. Exotic fruit flavors highlight a mouthfeel that is crisp and persistent. Imported by Paterno Wines International., 91.0, 88.0
US, Continuity Red Wine, Smooth, seductive, toasty and rich on the nose, this blend of all five Bordeaux varieties is not a big wine, but drinking extremely well at the moment, with a precise balance of fruit, earth and barrel that sets up seductively in the mouth, and stays there. Excellent length and fullness., 90.0, 24.0
Spain, Calvario, Dense black plum and berry aromas are earthy, flat and jammy by Calvario standards. Feels chewy and hefty, with grabby, driving tannins and roasted flavors of blackberry, espresso and herbs. Not as complex and interesting compared to great vintages, but still an impressive Rioja cut from a modern cloth. Drink now through 2016., 90.0, 124.0
France, Domaine des Perdrix Aux Perdrix Premier Cru, With its intense red fruits and acidity, this initially seems so fruity. Slowly the powerful structure comes into play, yielding a concentrated, cellar-worthy wine., 91.0, 98.0
Spain, Manzanilla, Top-notch manzanilla, plain and simple. What's not plain and simple is the fact that this is so pure and smooth that it dances across your palate. From the vanilla and almond on the nose to the pastry and mushroom on the palate to the creamed butter on the finish, this is as good as it gets in this class., 91.0, 9.0
France, Les Rugiens Premier Cru, Still firm, this wine is dominated by tannin and dark fruit, with a dry core typical of this Pommard vineyard. The red and dark plum-fruit flavors are developing slowly and the wine needs time to balance. Drink from 2019., 91.0, 109.0
Italy, Massi di Mandorlaia Riserva, This Riserva Morellino offers a wonderful bouquet of bright cherry, mature blackberry, plum and light spice. You feel the warm sunshine of southern Tuscany here thanks to the wine's natural thickness and intensity., 90.0, 34.0
US, , A brilliant, compelling Pinot Gris whose quality far exceeds its price. Bone dry, with moderate alcohol, it's big in flavor, offering a blast of Mandarin orange, peach, honeysuckle, vanilla and cinnamon spice. There's a rich texture, and the finish is thoroughly dry despite the richness., 91.0, 19.0
France, , Now at its best, this is a wine showing tannins, dry raisins as well as tense acidity. It is mature, ripe, definitely ready for drinking. It has secondary flavors of prunes, wood and smokiness, while the dryness at the core suggests it will not mature much longer., 91.0, 119.0
US, Corral Creek Vineyards, Chehalem makes four different Rieslings, and this is often the best of them. Rich and complex, it's dense with grapefruit, lemon, lime, apple and flavors of wet stone. Lovely in the mouth, it lingers gracefully through the finish., 91.0, 29.0
Italy, , Crushed rose, pressed violet, perfumed berry, sage and a balsamic note are just some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied red. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, black pepper and licorice alongside tightly knit tannins and the subtle warmth of alcohol. Give it a few more years to come together. Drink 2018–2016., 90.0, 44.0
Italy, Ursonia, Satisfying and delicious at every point. The bouquet is lovely; it delivers dense plum fruit, chili-like spice and mounds of wet earth. The palate is pure blackberry and dark plum, and it finishes smooth as silk, with just enough coarseness to add texture and grit. Firm but not hard. A definite winner from Abruzzo. Drink by the end of 2004., 91.0, 39.0
Italy, Mulinvecchio, This opens with earthy violet, underbrush and overripe black-skinned fruit aromas with a whiff of game. The juicy, chewy palate offers baked plum, fleshy black cherry, truffle and licorice flavors, framed by polished tannins. It finishes on a savory note., 91.0, 49.0
Italy, Annata, Sangiovese's naturally warm, earthy tones come straight at you and are surrounded by a pretty frame of red fruit, almond, red apple, plump berry and pipe tobacco. This is a distinctive, unique wine that boasts an individual personality and solid roots in Brunello tradition. It has chewy tannins, delicate flavors and a refreshing, long-lasting finish., 91.0, 149.0
Spain, Rojo Granrojo, Peppery and tough smelling, with tomato-leaf aromas. This is a bland, innocuous wine with a touch of berry sweetness on the midpalate but no complexity or follow through., 81.0, 9.0
US, Le Bon Climat Vineyard, La Fenetre scores with this lush, forward Pinot Noir that offers enough flavor to please almost anybody. It's enormously rich in raspberry and cherry pie filling, roasted almond granola, vanilla cream, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood flavors that are so delicious, they're sweet, except that the wine finishes dry. Great with lamb. Drink now., 91.0, 59.0
Portugal, 40-years old Tawny, This is definitely old, an acquired taste perhaps, the wine showing high wood acidity, with a tight character. Any fruit has gone, leaving pure acidity and a very mature texture., 91.0, 159.0
France, Blanc de Blancs Brut, Somehow this pure Chardonnay wine suffers from the Roederer preference for a higher dosage. With the Blanc de Blancs style, more minerality, something altogether more taut, would be better. That said, there is plenty to enjoy in this rich, full-bodied wine, with apricot as well as citrus flavors., 91.0, 69.0
Argentina, Malbec-Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon, Light prune aromas signify a wine on the cusp. Astringent and rubbery in the mouth, this is raw in feel and tastes raisiny and like briary raspberry., 81.0, 19.0
Italy, Vigneto La Casuccia, Vigneto La Casuccia is a big, meaty wine that when compared to Castello di Ama's base Chianti Classico offers a bolder, more masculine style. It's a bit overdone in places although 20% Merlot adds loads of structure and intensity., 91.0, 169.0
Hungary, Betsek Aszú 6 Puttonyos, A beautiful wine with unfolding aromas of orange peel, honey, vanilla and spice, with a viscous mélange of honey, spice and citrus on the palate. Elegant and flinty, with a luxurious finish., 91.0, 79.0
France, Les Chaumées Premier Cru, From the Picard family-owned château of Chassagne-Montrachet, this wine has some dusty, sweet tannins that go well with the red berry and plum flavors. With the freshening acidity, this is a densely textured wine that will develop well., 90.0, 64.0
France, En Grands Champs, The limestone soil gives this wine a mineral intensity that sits well with the smoky, meaty character of the Pinot Noir. The red fruits are full, laced with spice, smoky wood from 14-month aging, giving a rounded, rich satisfying finish., 90.0, 164.0
Chile, Organic, This smells forced and grapy, with murky undertones. Flabby on the palate, this organic red tastes nutty and earthy. An aftertaste of mulch and peanut is off base and highly questionable., 80.0, 14.0
France, Cuvée des Cadettes, Right now, this wine tastes like a somewhat generic red wine--albeit one with excellent balance, fine oaking and impressive concentration and length. Cedary, vanilla notes from new oak barrels need some time to integrate with the rich black cherry fruit and allow the true flavors of Châteauneuf to shine. Drink 2008–2015., 91.0, 89.0
US, Mojo, A lean, unbalanced, hot wine, whose blackberry flavors have an edge of vegetables., 81.0, 39.0
US, Le Rêve Blanc de Blancs, Domaine Carneros's finest Blanc de Blancs blend, it is made entirely from estate-grown fruit. This 2007 is distinguished by complex layers of pear compote and ginger spice—round, soft and still well-toned in acidity. As it ages expect more of the almond-hazelnut undertones to take center stage, a delightful accompaniment to fruit desserts, creamy French cheeses or salty shellfish., 91.0, 99.0
Italy, Altero, Concentrated and superripe with blackberry, plum, cedar, clove and coffee over a long, spicy finish. Firm, velvety tannins and toasted notes render a modern yet age-worthy wine. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd., 90.0, 74.0
France, Fleur de Champagne Blanc de Blancs Brut, A nutty aroma follows through to the mature palate of this distinguished Blanc de Blancs. It has a good element of acidity, toast and spice and an intense pear and mineral aftertaste., 91.0, 399.0
France, Caillou Blanc, Oily and unexpressive, with aromas of wax beans and butterscotch. Underripe nectarine flavors carry the dull palate to an equally boring finish. Tasted twice. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates., 80.0, 24.0
Uruguay, Angel's Cuvée Ripasso de Tannat, Very expensive for a novelty, and without coming down too hard on it, it's fat and raisiny with a heavy ripeness that is tough to swallow. Ripasso by nature is a rich, sweet, sticky style of wine but this rendition lacks edge and focus., 81.0, 59.0
France, Zero Dosage Grand Cru Brut, Very dry, packed with grapefruit juice flavors. At the same time, this is a tense, serious wine, with a great mineral presence, touch of toast and the potential to age in bottle. It is best with food., 90.0, 84.0
US, Cuvée J, Hot and medicinal, with baked flavors of berries., 80.0, 34.0
France, Génération XIX, A wonderful explosion of red berry fruits marks this wine as something special. The fruits lead to a smooth-textured, wood-aged wine that brings in an array of spices and a depth of ripe flavors, with finishing sweet acidity., 90.0, 194.0
US, Reserve, Way too high in alcohol, giving it the ripe, hot, raisiny taste of a simple Port., 80.0, 44.0
US, , This Châteauneuf-style wine is jammy, with black stone fruits, berries and dark chocolate, and a sweet black cherry core, but it has body and tannins to lend it weight. The winemaker suggests pairing it with cassoulet. New from Don Sebastiani & Sons., 90.0, 5.0
Italy, Bricco delle Viole Riserva, Aromas of this brawny wine suggest black plum, berry, violet, leather and dill. Notes of licorice, tobacco and black pepper back up the sour cherry fruit. Big with round tannins, this is just reaching its ideal drinking window. Drink through 2019., 90.0, 105.0
US, Olive Ridge Vineyard, Smells weedy and tastes feeble, with acids and tannins starring and overpowering the fruit. There's a suggestion of vegetables., 80.0, 54.0
New Zealand, Reserve, This top-notch effort features bold nectarine and pink grapefruit flavors artfully accented by the merest hints of smoky complexity. It's big and mouthfilling, finishing with just the right amount of nettle-y herbaceousness. Drink it over the next year or two., 90.0, 15.0
US, Elerding Vineyard Reserve, Smells rich and jammy--loaded with cassis and vanilla. In the mouth, there's more of the same, plus added notes of coffee and blackberry allied to a creamy, supple texture. Would rate even higher if not for the relatively short, tart finish., 90.0, 115.0
US, Suicide Shift, This Syrah/Mourvèdre blend is a forward, bright and seamless expression of peppery berry fruit. Tart, smooth and accessible, it's backed with refreshing minerality and a dollop of cocoa., 90.0, 25.0
US, , Big and dense in blackberry, currant, cherry and unsweetened baker's flavors, with a bitter finish. The tannins are young and astringent. It all suggests ageability. Try after 2008., 90.0, 125.0
Australia, Grange, The nose offers date and cassis notes, while the palate deals more cassis, plus raspberry, earth and oak as it opens. Its flavors are juicy, and its tannins, delicate and textured (one reviewer actually likened it to a Rhône wine). Not as full, powerful or overwhelming as the wine can be, but enjoyable nonetheless. Drink through 2012. Imported by Southcorp Wines., 90.0, 225.0
US, Delta The Difference, The vineyard for this 100% Grenache is certified sustainable, organic and Biodynamic. Bright and light in strawberry and mint, the wine has a strong herbal component intertwined with tartness and tingling acidity., 90.0, 35.0
US, Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard, The pedigree of the vineyard shows in this Cab. It's as intensely ripe as Cabernet gets, with a massive core of blackberry jam, cassis liqueur and chocolate, enriched with sweet new oak. But it's so balanced in tannins and acidity that it never feels over-the-top. The alcohol is quite high, though, which may limit ageability., 90.0, 135.0
Chile, Kai, This absurdly priced Carmenère is always one of Chile's best, and this vintage is just fine, with cherry, cassis, graphite, herb and eucalyptus-like green aromas. The palate is chunky and round in feel, with solid acidity and plump, herbal flavors of berry fruits, olive and spice. But what justifies a $235 price tag? You can be the judge., 90.0, 235.0
Italy, Vigneto di Monte Lodoletta, Winemaker Romano Dal Forno fearlessly confronted the soggy 2002 vintage with high extraction techniques and barrique aging (36 months). This is an inky, dense wine (more syrupy than it is vinous) with black currant, peppermill, chocolate fudge and big firm wood tannins. It is so monolithic, a viable food match is virtually impossible. As always, Dal Forno straddles a fine line between brilliance and exaggeration., 90.0, 535.0
Italy, Centenario, Celebrating 100 years of activity, Giuseppe Campagnola is one of Valpolicella's oldest and biggest producers. The company has a refurbished winery and three enormous hangers dedicated to grape appassimento. This anniversary wine delivers black berry fruit, chocolate, cherry cough drop and a smidgeon of cooked fruit and is aged in both barrique and oak cask., 90.0, 45.0
Spain, Viña El Pisón, Mildly burnt smelling, with whiffs of charred toast and forest fire. Plenty of black cherry, plum and brown sugar comprise the palate, which is also laden with licorice and spice. Numerous merits secure its place in the box seats, but could be too oaky for some folks., 90.0, 145.0
US, Four Boys Estate Vineyard, Pale in color but powerful in flavor, this Pinot is perfumed in cherry, cola, rose petal, roasted cedar wood and pepper aromas, with similar flavors. It's dense and full-bodied, and austere and unrewarding in youth. But it seems to have the structure to age. Best 2009–2011., 90.0, 55.0
Italy, 50 & 50, Careful winemaking has saved this blend from the hot vintage, preserving its vibrant aromas of red fruit, lavender flower, blueberry and almond. In fact, the wine manages to be delicate in fragrance and approach. Drink now., 90.0, 155.0
US, , As densely built as its name suggests, this wine is grippy with black fruit and robust tannin, its full-bodied concentration laced with integrated oak. Brooding blackberry and black cherry dominate the midpalate, with a one-two punch of chocolate and tobacco, finishing with clove and pepper spice., 90.0, 65.0
France, Cuvée Signature, This is broad and quite soft, with a dense, jammy red-fruit flavor. It has tannins that are buried in the rich fruit, giving shape to the wine. This is likely to mature soon., 90.0, 165.0
Argentina, , While this smells floral and candied, the palate rages, courtesy of strapping acidity that creates tart plum and blueberry flavors., 80.0, 5.0
France, , Like the 2005, this is a nutty wine, but it is also a touch crisper and should prove to be marginally longer-lived. Broad and mouthcoating, with layers of richness., 90.0, 75.0
France, Ex Voto, After 30 months in new oak, this needs some time to pull itself together. Right now, it's dominated by oaky notes of vanilla and spice. There does appear to be plenty of old-vine material underneath—you can ferret out hints of apricot and almond skin—so this rating may look stingy in 10 or more years., 90.0, 175.0
Uruguay, Identity Tannat, Not very lively or fruity. Vague aromas and flavors of nectarine and citrus are sticky, grabby and bland. Not a good rosé by any measuring stick., 80.0, 15.0
Australia, , Toasty and nutty upfront, with hints of minerality showing through, this is a refined Chardonnay that should have the structure to age. Despite being barrel-fermented, there's no malolactic fermentation, so it stays crisp through the long finish that barely hints at pear and peach., 90.0, 85.0
US, , A harsh, nasty Pinot Noir. It's just barely recommendable for the cherries and silky texture., 80.0, 25.0
Spain, Selecció Especial, Dark and dense, with aromas of rich black fruits, grilled meat and a lot of oak. The palate is extracted but it's not the least bit hard or biting. Flavors of Concord grapes and blackberry are sweet, and the finish keeps its fruit. Could it use more minerality and toughness? Maybe, but as is it's very approachable. Drink now through 2012., 90.0, 95.0
US, , A very good Opus with plenty of forward cherries and black raspberries as well as rich notes of spiced oak that give a nougat or crunchy vanilla granola sweetness to the finish. The vintage was not Opus One's best, but the wine is impeccably crafted, and shows its usual fine tannic structure., 90.0, 195.0
US, Statuesque, Sweet and unbalanced, but this blend of Cab, Syrah and Petite Sirah is clean, and will have its fans., 80.0, 35.0
US, , The grapes for this impressive Aussie-style Shiraz, from Lodi and Clarksburg, are ripe; the palate boasts has rich flavors of cherries, black raspberries, blueberries and plums. Feels succulent, with a smooth texture and a long, sweetish finish, but it's perfectly dry. At this price, you can't go wrong., 90.0, 6.0
France, Blanc de Blancs Brut, Still very young, this wine needs time to develop its intense minerality. Now it is more about grapefruit and yeast, although it is also full-bodied, a sign of the 1999 vintage. Wait five years at least., 90.0, 106.0
US, , Smells like cheap Port and drinks harsh and dry, with flavors of raisins and stewed black cherries. Drinkable, but just barely., 80.0, 45.0
US, Les Côtes de l'Ouest, This is a terrifically enjoyable wine from Terre Rouge. It shows a distinct white pepper note in the aroma, and floods the mouth with delicious blackberry jam, dark chocolate, oatmeal raisin cookie, mushu plum sauce and licorice flavors. Easy to drink now, but complex and layered., 90.0, 16.0
US, Private Reserve, Huge wine, young and tannic, almost bitter now and not offering much relief. But of course you don't buy Beringer PR tonight. There is indeed enormous Cabernet flavor deep down inside, offering oodles of blackberries and cherries and charry new oak, but there's also a warning note of prune. Best after 2008., 90.0, 116.0
US, St. Peter's Church Vineyard, With 17% alcohol, this Zin still has residual sugar. They must have picked the grapes insanely ripe. It's not a table wine, it's more like Port, but it's not without its pleasures., 80.0, 55.0
Italy, Strahler, Aging in large casks gives this wine structure without adding invasive wood sensations. It's loaded with white flower, mature Bartlett pear, tart green apple, mineral and finesse. The creamy palate is energized by crisp acidity., 90.0, 26.0
France, , With all of its firm tannins intact, this is a solid, dense and concentrated wine. Black fruits linger behind the dark structure. Age this powerful wine for 4–5 years., 90.0, 126.0
France, Les Clous, This is a great Meursault that's full of round, ripe, generous fruit. It's packed with yellow fruit and kiwi flavors. Revel in its richness. This wine comes from Bouchard's own vines., 90.0, 36.0
US, Reserve, Very dry and sharp, almost sour, with Lifesaver cherry flavors. Not going anywhere., 80.0, 65.0
Germany, Josephshofer Spätlese, With its delicate aromas of flowers, fresh greens and a hint of mint, you might expect this to be a light, delicate wine. But it's broad and rather sweet, marked by flavors of ripe apples and vanilla. It comes across a bit soft on the finish, but luscious., 90.0, 46.0
Italy, Privilegio, Mature notes of ripe peach and apricot immediately give this dessert wine's sunny, southern roots away. From sun-drenched Campania Felix, this is a viscous, syrupy treat with concentrated notes of fruit and nuts: almond, roasted chestnut and even a touch of peanut skin. This vintage is syrupy sweet in the mouth, but not as crisp., 90.0, 56.0
France, Le Limozin, Wood aromas dominate, but on the palate the toast element is showing good integration with the round, full, white and yellow stone fruit flavors. There is a crisp green apple acidity that comes through to finish, although the toast character stays as well. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports., 90.0, 66.0
France, Egérie de Pannier Rosé de Saignée, Fragrant and deeply colored, I like the intensity of the flavors, which include dried herb, orange peel, citrus and pear. It's an interesting, somewhat offbeat wine—a more complex, more rustic and evolved style., 90.0, 76.0
Argentina, Antigua Cava, Almost transparent in color, with leafy, lightly baked aromas. The palate offers tart raspberry and hard, citric tannins and acidity., 80.0, 6.0
US, , There aren't lots of Cabs coming off this mountain but it's a pretty good guarantee of quality. This is a tannic young wine, rather dry and astringent now, but it has a huge core of molten cherry and blackberry fruit, with enough balance for the long haul. Hold until 2009, then drink for the next six years or so., 90.0, 86.0
Argentina, , Despite all the back-label talk of richness and layer-cake complexities, this wine lacks much of the sweet, yummy character that folks love about Argentine Malbec. We acknowledge that 2007 was an abnormally cool year in Mendoza, but what's here is lean, disjointed and angular., 80.0, 16.0
France, Reynard, A step up from Allemand's Chaillot bottling, the 2004 Reynard boasts more intense cassis fruit and even some licorice and spice notes. It's rich, layered and tannic, needing some time to show its best. Drink 2010–2020., 90.0, 96.0
US, Portfolio Collection, More woodsy than fruity, with just a few cherry notes peaking out from behind the humus and forest floor overtones. Chambourcin's off-beat personality asserts itself in the mouth, where candied notes and vanilla from oak treatment dominate. Short, slightly sharp finish., 80.0, 26.0
Portugal, Serrado Colheita, A darkly tannic wine, very mineral, tasting of the granite Dão soil. The wine is taut, fresh with black currants, its structure a major element. For aging 3–4 years., 90.0, 7.0
US, , Harsh texture, sharp acidity and green tannins. Won't age., 80.0, 36.0
France, Clos Triguedina Petit Clos, Big and dark, its fruit dominated by bone-dry tannins, this is anything but petit (little). The density of the texture is balanced on a structure of the dark fruits, black plums and chocolate, with a fresh line of acidity holding it all in place., 90.0, 17.0
France, Grèves Premier Cru, Young vines, planted in 2007, give a fresh, fruity wine with attractive citrus and zingy orange flavors. It is ripe and deliciously perfumed with a touch of minerality and saltiness. Drink from 2019., 90.0, 117.0
US, Judge Family Vineyard, Novy's Syrahs have really hit their stride lately. This one, from this little Sonoma County appellation, is soft and rich in blackberries, blueberries and Canadian bacon, with a smoky layer of charred oak. It is, in a word, delicious., 90.0, 27.0
Spain, Altos de Lanzaga, The price on this high-flying Rioja continues to go through the roof, and so does the oak and tannin. And while we still appreciate the wine's intensity and power, this vintage pushes so much espresso, burnt nut and rubber that it probably won't impress all comers. In the mouth, look for dark, almost bitter black-fruit flavors followed by a firm, tannic finish. Needs time in the cellar to find more integration. Hold for another year before checking on its status., 90.0, 127.0
South Africa, Classique, A savory nose with hints of balsamic and smoke, balanced by cassis and cedar, start this wine out right. In the mouth, it's complex and assertive, with flavors of anise, spice and plum. Pronounced tannins need some time to age, but overall the wine is excellent now., 90.0, 37.0
Portugal, Colheita, This wood-aged, fortified Moscatel has retained its fruitiness while also showing older, wood and toast flavors. Perfumed and fragrant, with integrated acidity, enjoy this offering soon., 90.0, 137.0
France, Beauroy Premier Cru, Dominated by wood, spice and almonds, this is a structured wine that moves in a straight line from its white fruits to ageworthy acidity and toast. It is still young, a wine that needs time to mellow, to move away from its tense fruit., 90.0, 47.0
Australia, Serpico, Made from grapes dried passito-style, this is an excellent Cab. Well balanced with soft tannins, it shows earth and focused blackberry aromas, and very juicy blackberry and plum fruit. Pretty, unique and worth seeking out., 90.0, 57.0
France, Château Tour Robert, A selection of Merlot from Château Robert, this is a concentrated, solid wine. It is still young, with its firm structure and juicy acidity still right up front. Black currant, smoky spice and red berry freshness combine with the aging potential of the dry core. Age for 4–5 years., 90.0, 67.0
Argentina, Parcela 26 Limited Edition, After picking yourself up off the floor having digested the price, the wine is excellent but not otherwordly. Sweet, dense and calm on the nose, with alluring black fruit and raisin aromas. Feels hefty and gritty, with rooty, sweet flavors of brown sugar and baked blackberry. Finishes round, big and smooth, with generally good balance. 120 cases made; drink now through 2014., 90.0, 167.0
Canada, Icewine Gold, High-toned apple-cider aromas on the nose belie the gorgeously fresh palate. This is lip-smackingly good, with a concentrated fresh-fruit flavor that's sweet and bright with notes of hibiscus nectar and honey. It lingers long and smooth on the finish., 90.0, 77.0
Germany, Casteller Schlossberg Trockenbeerenauslese, This wine reeks of intensity, from its powerful aromas of musk and dried pineapple to its somewhat monolithic honeyed fruit flavors and enormous sugar levels. It's impressively concentrated—enough to stand up to almost any dessert you choose to throw at it., 90.0, 177.0
Italy, Söri Rio Sordo, The 2007 Söri Rio Sordo is far more impressive than the 2006 edition. Warm temperatures and a long growing season have surely played an important part in developing the aromas of black fruit, sweet spice, plum and dried prune that come forward. The wine shows elegance and integration with a firm, unyielding tannic structure., 90.0, 87.0
Uruguay, , Peanut and leather aromas, with a candied sweetness to the palate. Sweet and sugary, maybe a likable trait for some., 80.0, 7.0
US, Noche Sweet Table Wine, The color of castor oil, this sweet table wine offers clove and root beer flavors that cling to the finish., 80.0, 17.0
US, White, Mostly old vine (mid-1970s) Riesling, this has 11.7% alcohol and about 1% residual sugar. This is a gorgeous bottle, with floral fragrances that pile on acacia, rose petals and citrus blossom, and then moves into a luscious midpalate loaded with apples, peaches and citrus. The wine is seamless and well defined, with a perfect mix of fruit-forward flavors and the cut and precision of an ageworthy, German-style Kabinett., 90.0, 8.0
France, Les Clos Grand Cru Clos des Hospices dans Les Clos, A complex name for this finely crafted wine. It shows green fruits and oak, some intensity of flavor and a great layer of acidity, cutting through the rich fruits. The finish brings all this acidity forward, giving a classic Chablis minerality., 90.0, 108.0
US, Connor Lee Vineyard, Since 1993 Arbor Crest has done this single-vineyard Cabernet Franc. As with all these wines the aromas set up the palate—scents of berry, tobacco and fresh ground coffee. In the mouth it carries on with very clean and fresh fruit, ripe and chewy/herbal tannins, excellent acid balance and a light bitter coffee finish., 90.0, 18.0
New Zealand, Grey Ghost, Strongly vegetal, with notes of ramps and other odiferous veggies. Disappointing., 80.0, 27.0
US, Old Vine, The wine is close in quality to Dry Creek's spectacular single-vineyard '05 Zins, without quite the same power. Dry and softly tannic, it features flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate, cola and spice., 90.0, 28.0
Spain, Dolç de l'Obac, Intriguing but expensive sweet wine, with leather and dried cheese aromas as well as dusty, rubbery black fruits and licorice. It's not that unusual or exciting in terms of mouthfeel, but the flavors of cassis liqueur, stewed cherry and black licorice are tight and powerful. Structured to last another decade, with meaty tannins and molasses on the finish., 90.0, 128.0
US, Estate, For the past several years, Monticello has been quietly producing deliciously drinkable Syrahs. The '05 is rich in cassis, cherry, mocha, violet, leather and spicy flavors, wrapped into a smooth, velvety texture., 90.0, 38.0
France, , As with Clos de Vougeot in red, every producer needs a Corton-Charlemagne white. Aegerter's contribution is soft, honeyed and warm. It has hints of the concentration proper to this Grand Cru vineyard, allowing for a perfumed, ripe fruit character. It will develop quickly and will be ready to drink from 2017., 90.0, 238.0
US, , Using fruit sourced from Ghielmetti Ranch, Home Ranch and Folkendt vineyards, this is comprised of 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. This is Steven Kent's most approachable Cabernet; It's lush and concentrated, with bright flavors of grenadine and hazelnut, plus straightforward tannins. Ready to drink now, it will still be vibrant in 5–7 years., 90.0, 48.0
Italy, Pajoré, This unique Barbaresco delivers power and personality with aromas of cherry liqueur, tar, asphalt, mesquite and slight touches of barbecue smoke. More than fruity aromas, you get floral ones here, especially red rose and violet. In the mouth, the wine is silky, tight and fresh., 90.0, 58.0
France, Cuvée William Deutz Brut, Features an interesting blend of flavors that range from mature mushroom and toast notes to youthful apples and stone fruits. Throughout, there's a crisp, minerally undercurrent. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA., 90.0, 158.0
US, Calkins Lane Vineyard, One of the most distinctive among Adelsheim's single-vineyard Pinot Noirs, the Calkins Lane bottling does not shy away from earthy, herbal flavors, including forest floor, truffle and wet leaf. But there's plenty of fruit, a mix of ripe red apple, pomegranate, wild cherry and plum., 90.0, 68.0
New Zealand, Prima Donna, Full-bodied and surprisingly muscular for a Prima Donna, the 2004 features big plum and black cherry fruit, wrapped in hints of hickory smoke, mint and cola. Finishes with enough dusty tannins to suggest cellaring another year or two. Imported by Meadowbank Estates., 90.0, 78.0
France, , This is old-style winemaking, but in the best sense. It is big, dominated at this stage by tannins. The fruit is dark, brooding and intense. It has layers of wood (of which 20 percent was new), while the acidity still needs to soften out. This will age, maybe 10-12 years., 90.0, 88.0
France, Rosé de Saignée Premier Cru Brut, A wine made by using the color from the grape skins rather than the more normal Champagne method of adding red wine to give color to rosé. It gives a deep pink color with a wine that is rich, complex, full of red cherry and raspberry flavors., 90.0, 98.0
US, , Aromatically inviting, with a lovely mix of sweet grass and light, fresh sugar pea scents. Tart, spicy passionfruit, grapefruit and starfruit flavors contribute to a lovely bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, with plenty of acidity that does not turn at all sour., 90.0, 9.0
Spain, Satinela- Medium Sweet, This medium-sweet wine has a lot of issues. First off, it smells like cooked bananas. Next, the palate is like mango cotton candy. Third, the juice itself will take a coat of enamel off your teeth. Need more? Imported by Vineyard Brands., 80.0, 8.0
Australia, Diana Madeline, Crisp and compact, the 2011 Diana Madeline undoubtedly needs at least another couple of years in the cellar. The nose is leafy and herbal, but the flavors show cherry fruit framed by subtle shadings of vanilla. The tannins are firm, imparting a drying sensation to the long finish., 90.0, 109.0
Spain, Crianza, Dry and smooth, with balsam and cedar aromas wrapped around controlled fruit scents and toast. The wine is ripe and balanced, with hickory flavors adding a barbecued angle to the steady palate. Firm, structured and tasting of clove and woodspice on the finish. Drink now through 2011., 90.0, 19.0
US, , After the sulfur smell blows off, this wine remains tough in acids and tannins., 80.0, 18.0
US, , A very classy effort, with the barrel influence pulled back and the fruit ripened to a nice blend of berry and raisin. Tannins are firm and slightly scrapey; and the structure overall brings the fruit, tannin, acids and oak into good balance. The finish lingers with threads of smoke and coffee., 90.0, 29.0
Italy, Vigna Rionda, Aromas recall fennel, grilled herb, leather, mocha and a whiff of balsam. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, the palate is already evolved but still shows dried black cherry and black pepper. Drink through 2017., 90.0, 129.0
US, Dorothy's Vineyard, Wilson has had trouble controlling the alcohol level in the past, and the '05 is higher, hotter and sweeter than ever. The official reading is 16%. The wine is soft, flabby and tastes frankly of mashed cherries liberally mixed with white sugar., 80.0, 28.0
US, Reserve Santa Barbara Highlands Vineyard South Mesa, Lots of words in the title of this Syrah, from a newly established negociant. The wine is dry and tannic, but it's very rich and ripe in blackberry and cherry flavors that have a jam-like quality, and finish with the tastes of black pepper and anisette liqueur. Has just enough complexity to serve with fine foods., 90.0, 39.0
Israel, Yarden Katzrin, Only made in exceptional years, the 2007 Katzrin is a Cab-based wine with 9% Merlot that's aged for two years in French oak. It's lush and fruit forward, with aromas and flavors of cassis, black cherry and plum framed by spicy accents of cigar box, fruit cake and cracked black peppercorns. Round and creamy on the palate with a rich mocha and licorice-infused finish., 90.0, 139.0
US, The Peasant, A red Rhône blend that's too soft, hot and sweet. It has the taste of sugary raspberry jam and is not a dry table wine., 80.0, 38.0
US, Ice Wine, Intensely honeyed with flourishes of citrus, saffron and lanolin, this ice wine is a showcase for the grape's exuberantly floral, fruity personality, backed by focused lemon-lime acidity. It's dreamy on the finish, lingering long, rich and sweet on the palate., 90.0, 49.0
Chile, Carmín de Peumo, Intense and compact on the nose, this has cola, mint, cassis and blackberry aromas that are tightly knit. The palate is narrow and intense, with lightly herbal, reedy flavors of saucy, savory berry and herb. This is a leading Carmenère, but it's not as flavorful and substantive as prior years., 90.0, 149.0
Italy, , A big, fat, jolly wine with many of the warm, friendly qualities of the '03 vintage. On the nose it shows dark jammy fruit, coffee and spices. On the palate, it is solid and slightly rustic, with a medium finish although there is a touch of alcohol at the end., 90.0, 59.0
US, Four Flags, A blend of Cabernet from Grand Ciel (31%), Ciel du Cheval (30%), Upchurch (28%) and Klipsun (11%) vineyards, wood spice aromas start out up front. The cherry flavors are light and elegant, with the tannins bringing some grip., 90.0, 69.0
Italy, Vigneto Bellavista, . There's a compact, traditional characteristic here that gives this wine smooth, sophisticated appeal. Aromas include white cherry, dried raspberry, tar, licorice and root beer. Twenty percent Malvasia Nera is added to the blend., 90.0, 169.0
Spain, , Woody plum and berry aromas are a bit more raw and angular than in past vintages. This feels abnormally bright and lively for Paixar, which is normally a dark full-bodied type of Mencía. Flavors of baked black plum and oaky coconut finish toasty and long, but low on fruit. Drink through 2023., 90.0, 79.0
Spain, Aro, A compact red with aromatic hints of tobacco, violets and dark berries. Fueled in high-octane fashion, meaning it's tight, tannic and forward. While it needs five years to loosen up, now you get refined black cherry and chocolate. A stern drink for those who favor big reds. Tempranillo with 30% Graciano., 90.0, 179.0
Germany, Casteller Schlossberg Trockenbeerenauslese, Very honeyed and sweet, with bold flavors of apricot and mango that seem almost caramelized in their sugary intensity. Drink now and over the next few years., 90.0, 279.0
France, Dessus le Mont Blanc de Blancs Premier Cru Brut, Here's a wine that is fine and fresh as well as structured. Apple skin and citrus juice flavors are cut through with mature toast flavors. The result is rich, its mouthfeel full and its aftertaste tight and tangy., 90.0, 89.0
France, Brut Prestige, With its rich toasty aroma and ripe creamed apple palate, this is a rich Champagne reflecting the vintage. It is well balanced, with toffee softness and lime juice acidity. Not for aging, but currently very enjoyable., 90.0, 99.0
Chile, Paso del Sol, Past its prime, if it ever had one. This is not particularly good rosé by any standards. The nose is weedy and burnt, while the palate is flat and carries that same burnt-fruit, acrid character as the bouquet. Lacks freshness, so take a pass., 80.0, 9.0
Israel, Reserve, The nose offers earthy, medicinal notes on the light black-cherry fruit. Thin on the palate, it has a cough syrup-like taste. The tannins are soft, the acids low. Finishes short., 80.0, 19.0
Spain, Spiga, In general O. Fournier gets it right, be it in Spain or Argentina. But this Ribera del Duero struggles from the outset. It's rubbery, damp and lacks clarity of fruit. And the feel is sharp and lemony, seemingly a combo of excessive oak and raw fruit. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain., 80.0, 29.0
US, Reserve, The nose is less than appealing, with green notes meshing with prune and nail polish aromas. High acid and moderate tannins support decent purple fruit and almond skin flavors. A disappointment compared to the East End bottling., 80.0, 39.0
Italy, Occhio di Pernice, Thick as molasses and dark as caramelized brown sugar, the wine oozes out of the bottle releasing concentrated aromas of butterscotch, toffee, honey, licorice, coffee, resin and maple syrup. Grapes from the Montepulciano area are dried in a ventilated room and the wine ages over 10 years in tiny oak barrels resulting in thick, dark concentration. Don't pair it with food: Vin Santo as good as this deserves to be enjoyed alone, as a so-called “meditation wine.”, 100.0, 210.0
US, Genoa, This Zin, Syrah and Petite Sirah blend smells and tastes like Port, only not as good. Thin, dry and hot., 80.0, 79.0
Italy, Masseto, A perfect wine from a classic vintage, the 2007 Masseto (100% Merlot from a 17-acre vineyard of the same name) opens with an unabashedly opulent bouquet of delicious blackberry, cherry, chocolate, vanilla, exotic spice and cinnamon. Masseto excels both in terms of quality of fruit and winemaking and delivers plush, velvety tannins and an extra long, supple finish. It will make a special and valuable collection to your cellar., 100.0, 460.0
US, Hillside Select, A perfect score has to be considered in the context of its region. Shafer's 2004 Hillside Select is tremendous as a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon that competes with its peers at the highest levels. It's always a fabulous wine, but in warm 2004, Shafer's amphitheater vineyard sheltered the grapes, ripening them to perfection yet protecting the “iron fist in a velvet glove” structure that André Tchelistcheff defined as Stags Leap. This 100% Cabernet is tremendous in cassis, black currant and mocha flavors, and the 100% new French oak provides perfect additions of smoke and caramel. It's soft and gorgeous enough to drink now, and should age well in a cool cellar for the next 20 years., 100.0, 215.0
US, Red Wine, Impossibly aromatic. Hard to imagine greater claret perfume. Shows the most refined mingling of smoky oak, cassis, cherries, roasted coconut macaroon, cocoa puff and spice scents. Absolutely first rate, as good as anything Napa Valley produces. Compellingly, addictively delicious, but so dry and voluptuous. Classic wine, with perfect alignment of fruit, acids, tannins, oak, alcohol, the works. The grapes are from Sloan's portion of the Sacrashe Vineyard, high above the Silverado Trail in the Vaca Mountains. Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in 100% new French oak. Perfection in a bottle. Drink now–2020., 100.0, 245.0
US, En Chamberlin Vineyard, In a stunning lineup of Cayuse Syrahs, the En Chamberlin wins by a nose. It's smooth and silky, with a tongue-bending blend of flavors that include blood and iron, umami and salt, at first overtaking the pure fruit, but adding tremendous depth and power. The endless finish unfolds into a wine with exotic spices and complex layering., 100.0, 65.0
Italy, Guado de' Gemoli, This small, family-run estate in the heart of Bolgheri has delivered a wine so beautiful and elegant, it is catapulted to the level of landmark vintages of its celebrated neighbors, Sassicaia and Ornellaia. Inky concentration sets the stage for generous, but perfectly integrated, aromas of spice, chocolate and dark fruit. There's firm roundness in the mouth, followed by unforgettable persistence. Hold this wine 15 years or more., 100.0, 195.0
France, , Full of ripe fruit, opulent and concentrated, this is a fabulous and impressive wine. It has a beautiful line of acidity balanced with ripe fruits. The wood aging is subtle, just a hint of smokiness and toast. This is one of those wines, from a great white wine vintage, that will age many years. Drink from 2024., 100.0, 848.0
